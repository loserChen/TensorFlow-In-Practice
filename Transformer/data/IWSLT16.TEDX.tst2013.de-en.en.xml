<seg id="1">Yes , hello .</seg>
<seg id="2">Good evening .</seg>
<seg id="3">I brought along a story .</seg>
<seg id="4">The story of the highest mountain in the world .</seg>
<seg id="5">And there are two reasons why I 'm telling you this story and why I 'll be reporting from my diary of the last five years .</seg>
<seg id="6">One reason is a very personal one .</seg>
<seg id="7">I decided to start living and working differently five years ago .</seg>
<seg id="8">and what I 'm about to tell you really happened to me .</seg>
<seg id="9">they ’ re not some sort of concepts and ideas that I simply made up .</seg>
<seg id="10">The second reason I want to tell you about the highest mountain in the world is that our society is right in the middle of a huge transformation process and we are often faced with thinking barriers and self-imposed mental blocks .</seg>
<seg id="11">And I 'd like to talk about these self-imposed mental blocks by using this metaphor or story about the highest mountain in the world and talking to you about it .</seg>
<seg id="12">When you do empirical research about what people consider to be the highest mountain in the world , then many minds come up with , and also in conversations I had with people , regardless of their profession , regardless of their background or the cultural circles they move in , the answer usually is that Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world .</seg>
<seg id="13">And I often asked myself , while doing my empirical research , whether I was also sure that the highest mountain in the world is Mount Everest .</seg>
<seg id="14">And everyone claims with utter certainty , yes , the highest mountain in the world is Mount Everest .</seg>
<seg id="15">That 's totally normal to us .</seg>
<seg id="16">This image in our head that the highest mountain in the world is over eight thousand metres high .</seg>
<seg id="17">I thought the same thing until two thousand and eight .</seg>
<seg id="18">and I gave exactly the same answer .</seg>
<seg id="19">until I stood at the top .</seg>
<seg id="20">and someone said to me , welcome to the highest mountain in the world .</seg>
<seg id="21">Which somehow unsettled me a bit , because it messed up the picture I 'd had up till then of seeing the world somehow , yes .</seg>
<seg id="22">And the person who said welcome to the highest mountain in the world said , you know what , it has to do with the frame of reference we use when looking at mountains .</seg>
<seg id="23">And depending on the frame of reference we use when looking at a mountain , one mountain or another is the highest in the world .</seg>
<seg id="24">if you measure a mountain from sea level , then this is the highest mountain in the world .</seg>
<seg id="25">And if you measure a mountain from , well , the beginning of the mountain , then Mauna Kea on Hawaii , with ten thousand two hundred and fifty metres , is the highest mountain in the world .</seg>
<seg id="26">That then made me curious and thoughtful somehow .</seg>
<seg id="27">And I started to experiment , in my thoughts at first .</seg>
<seg id="28">and then in my life and in my work .</seg>
<seg id="29">I looked into the question of whether the exact same might apply to management , economy , the banking and financial industry , in that we have a fixed opinion about these three phenomena , a fixed frame of reference .</seg>
<seg id="30">And that , when taking a closer look , you can look at these things through a different frame of reference .</seg>
<seg id="31">And then in two thousand and nine I started having conversations , reading books , going to events .</seg>
<seg id="32">Organising events myself .</seg>
<seg id="33">Always focusing on the question of whether there are other frames of reference in management , economy , the banking and financial industry .</seg>
<seg id="34">And I can tell you one thing , there are other frames of reference .</seg>
<seg id="35">They exist .</seg>
<seg id="36">They 're available .</seg>
<seg id="37">The exciting question is whether we want to see them .</seg>
<seg id="38">This quote frequently accompanied me on my expedition .</seg>
<seg id="39">The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes , but in having new eyes .</seg>
<seg id="40">I 'd like to give an impetus by looking at a frame of reference for management , a frame of reference for economy , and a frame of reference for the banking and financial industry .</seg>
<seg id="41">And there 's no need to be afraid that I , as an Austrian , will start talking about mountain climbing now and that you 'll have to get out a rope and pick and that we 'll go on an excursion .</seg>
<seg id="42">We 're already on an excursion , but a mental one and not actually a mountain climbing expedition .</seg>
<seg id="43">Management is the first subject that we 'll shed some light on .</seg>
<seg id="44">The classic frame of reference in management , the Mount Everest of management , you could call it , is characterised by a few aspects that are entirely normal to us .</seg>
<seg id="45">Management is hierarchy .</seg>
<seg id="46">Management is command and control .</seg>
<seg id="47">Management is , there are those who lead , and there are those who carry out .</seg>
<seg id="48">And it 's also entirely normal to have the view in management that it needs change .</seg>
<seg id="49">It , the company , the circumstances , yes .</seg>
<seg id="50">And usually it 's the manager , the person , who is at the forefront of this change process .</seg>
<seg id="51">When you ask people what irritates and annoys them most about their work , then the term change management is often cited , because something always has to change somehow .</seg>
<seg id="52">Another frame of reference in management that I came across in many , many discussions and which I practice myself today is management innovation .</seg>
<seg id="53">Managers work on their own quality , change the perspective of the company , the clients and all the stakeholders using their own qualities , thus bringing in an entirely different change dynamic for the company , entirely different compared to when you simply always change the circumstances or they change .</seg>
<seg id="54">The old paradigm , the Mount Everest of management , is to change from the outside , the Mauna Kea of management is to change from the inside .</seg>
<seg id="55">Economy as another frame of reference .</seg>
<seg id="56">The Mount Everest of economy is also in our heads , in our hearts , in our actions .</seg>
<seg id="57">Completely obvious .</seg>
<seg id="58">When you ask people , what do you associate with economy ?</seg>
<seg id="59">Then students , all the way to those who have been professionally active in leadership positions for years , will very , very quickly answer , economy is rivalry , economy is competition , and economy is profit seeking .</seg>
<seg id="60">It 's it 's entirely normal for us to , well , think of economy in this way .</seg>
<seg id="61">The Mauna Kea of economy is entirely different .</seg>
<seg id="62">The Mauna Kea of economy might be that all economic activity serves the common welfare .</seg>
<seg id="63">And , ladies and gentleman , all economic activity serving the common welfare is not just an esoteric possibility that some softies came up with .</seg>
<seg id="64">But all economic activity serves the common welfare is included in the Bavarian constitution , among other places .</seg>
<seg id="65">Very prominently .</seg>
<seg id="66">Basically the way we want to carry out economic activity and how we relate to the economy as a society is anchored there .</seg>
<seg id="67">A second aspect of Mauna Kea , of the close frame of reference for the economy , is to focus on striving for the common welfare and not profit seeking .</seg>
<seg id="68">There is a social movement , the common welfare economy , in which I 've been involved on a voluntary and civic basis to a high degree for a year and a half now , where , by now , over a thousand companies carry out their economic activity in a different way , who understand and practice their economic activity as a striving for the common welfare and cooperation and not according to the old paradigm of Mount Everest .</seg>
<seg id="69">Here in Stuttgart there is a regional group , an initiative .</seg>
<seg id="70">and there are the first pioneering companies here in Stuttgart that practice their economic activity in a different way , yes .</seg>
<seg id="71">And thus create a different frame of reference .</seg>
<seg id="72">The third frame of reference , which I dealt with on my research and development excursion is the banking and financial system .</seg>
<seg id="73">There are two reasons why I looked at the banking and financial system .</seg>
<seg id="74">On the one hand I once studied to be a banker in the dim and distant past and was always active in bank management .</seg>
<seg id="75">It 's my profession , and I still like and appreciate it very , very much .</seg>
<seg id="76">That 's one reason , and the other reason is that in two thousand and eight , two thousand and nine , we were in the middle of the financial crisis and many things we had considered completely normal in the past started to falter .</seg>
<seg id="77">The Mount Everest of banks is that we think it 's entirely normal for banks to be involved in global financial and casino capitalism and to be highly speculative enterprises .</seg>
<seg id="78">It 's entirely normal for us to somehow accept that banks have nothing to do with the real economy .</seg>
<seg id="79">The only thing I often get the impression does still annoy us about banks is that there are somehow managers who have high salaries , which is certainly an aspect .</seg>
<seg id="80">But the real problem is that the bank 's system is a speculative and no longer a real economic aspect .</seg>
<seg id="81">That 's the Mount Everest of the banking system .</seg>
<seg id="82">If you look at banks through the Mauna Kea glasses , through a different frame of reference , then it makes sense of course that banks exist to turn money back into a means for the common welfare and which simply leave behind the old paradigms of a monetary and financial system and redefine them .</seg>
<seg id="83">And of course it makes sense that there are banks that finance projects that are , well , common welfare-oriented and that finance subjects that we are driving forward in society .</seg>
<seg id="84">I 've mentioned it , that old frame of reference bad bank .</seg>
<seg id="85">It was used often enough in two thousand and eight , two thousand and nine during the financial market crisis .</seg>
<seg id="86">What It 's not only about abolishing banks , but about seeing banks differently , yes , helping to create good banks basically .</seg>
<seg id="87">I 've been involved in a project for almost a year with a group of one hundred and twenty active people , in Austria , in Vienna , , who are currently setting up a good bank .</seg>
<seg id="88">We , that is , a voluntary , civil and social initiative comprising one hundred and twenty people are currently preparing the founding of a good bank .</seg>
<seg id="89">And this good bank , we 're not doing it for our one hundred and twenty people , we 're basically just the founding committee .</seg>
<seg id="90">We 're just taking the first steps .</seg>
<seg id="91">We 're seeing to it that it gets out onto the streets .</seg>
<seg id="92">Yes .</seg>
<seg id="93">We want to see this bank reaching twelve thousand , twenty thousand , thirty thousand people .</seg>
<seg id="94">And the best thing would be for every one of the bank 's clients to be one of the owners too .</seg>
<seg id="95">Because we believe this is an essential prerequisite for not only setting up a bank as a good bank , but also for it to remain a good bank .</seg>
<seg id="96">And possibly this idea of founding , well , a new bank , having a new kind of bank , will celebrate a triumphal procession through Austria or Germany too .</seg>
<seg id="97">And maybe I can then report on how the whole thing happened at other Teds or Ted X events .</seg>
<seg id="98">We 're right in the middle of preparing the founding .</seg>
<seg id="99">In the in the second half of the year , now , in two thousand and thirteen , we will apply for a concession at the Forum for Financial Market Supervision and the bank will be set up in two thousand and fourteen .</seg>
<seg id="100">In Austria , to start off with .</seg>
<seg id="101">If we find one hundred and twenty people here in Stuttgart , I could do the project in Stuttgart too again .</seg>
<seg id="102">Then we 'll found our own bank again there .</seg>
<seg id="103">I can tell you one thing , many people said at the beginning , that 's not possible , starting up your own bank .</seg>
<seg id="104">It certainly is .</seg>
<seg id="105">And it 's very easy too .</seg>
<seg id="106">It 's just quite a lot of work , but that 's not so bad .</seg>
<seg id="107">The work can be done .</seg>
<seg id="108">And if you divide it up between one hundred and twenty people , you can manage that well too .</seg>
<seg id="109">The quintessential aspect when thinking with frames of reference is that every voyage , even if it 's very long , starts with the first step .</seg>
<seg id="110">And I personally decided to take the first steps five years ago .</seg>
<seg id="111">My life , my work and my loves look very different now than they did five years ago .</seg>
<seg id="112">I would have never dared to dream that I 'd be standing on the stage now and quoting from my diary .</seg>
<seg id="113">And that pleases me every day and every hour .</seg>
<seg id="114">I can only encourage you to simply question the frames of reference , question the things that are completely obvious to you .</seg>
<seg id="115">Things where you say , it 's simply like that .</seg>
<seg id="116">Political speak tends to like to use the phrase there is no alternative .</seg>
<seg id="117">whenever , you hear this inner voice rise up and say , there is no alternative , take a closer look .</seg>
<seg id="118">Perhaps it 's supported by this Mount Everest image , or Mauna Kea , and just look and ask yourself , is that really true ?</seg>
<seg id="119">Or isn 't there simply another frame of reference for exactly the subject you are dealing with .</seg>
<seg id="120">There are another nine presentations at Ted X today .</seg>
<seg id="121">I can imagine , I haven 't heard them , I only know as much about them as you , I can imagine that there will be one of two aspects , ways of looking at things differently too , looking at things through different glasses .</seg>
<seg id="122">And I 'm just excited to hear the conversations the many people here will have in the breaks .</seg>
<seg id="123">Yes , always with the object of researching what frame of reference you are dealing with most at any given moment .</seg>
<seg id="124">What is your normal frame of reference and which one could be your new one .</seg>
<seg id="125">Thanks for listening , and enjoy the event .</seg>
<seg id="126">And I hope there are some lively conversations to come .</seg>

<talkid>E02_Keine-Chance-Also-Los-Kaija-Lan</talkid>
<seg id="1">Thank you very much .</seg>
<seg id="2">Thank you .</seg>
<seg id="3">Thank you very much .</seg>
<seg id="4">Is the mic working ?</seg>
<seg id="5">Yes , it seems to work .</seg>
<seg id="6">Great .</seg>
<seg id="7">I would like to ask you to briefly close your eyes and think of the person who is the reason you are here today .</seg>
<seg id="8">The reason you have done a degree , the reason you have managed to graduate from school and you have managed to find your own way .</seg>
<seg id="9">You can now open your eyes again , but maybe keep that person in the back of your mind .</seg>
<seg id="10">This role model .</seg>
<seg id="11">I also had a person like that .</seg>
<seg id="12">It was Mister Barrett .</seg>
<seg id="13">Mister Barrett was my English teacher from eighth grade .</seg>
<seg id="14">I had started learning English a long time before that .</seg>
<seg id="15">But every time I knew that I would soon have to go to class , I would get all flustered .</seg>
<seg id="16">And I would really rather just run away .</seg>
<seg id="17">What I was most scared of , was speaking in English or having to read a text out loud .</seg>
<seg id="18">And then came Mister Barrett , and he really did not care .</seg>
<seg id="19">He also did not care about what I said or how I said it .</seg>
<seg id="20">The only thing he found important , was that I said something .</seg>
<seg id="21">And he tried to break it down for me , and with that he got me to start learning the English language piece by piece .</seg>
<seg id="22">One year later , I applied to go on a student exchange in Los Angeles .</seg>
<seg id="23">And I was the second best in English in my year , during my school leaving examinations .</seg>
<seg id="24">What does that mean ?</seg>
<seg id="25">That I was lucky .</seg>
<seg id="26">I had a role model and I had someone to support me .</seg>
<seg id="27">And I had someone who believed in me and encouraged me to learn this language .</seg>
<seg id="28">And therefore , I have learned a lot that I can use for the rest of my life .</seg>
<seg id="29">Unfortunately , in Germany there are many many children and young people , who do not have such role models and support .</seg>
<seg id="30">In figures , it looks as though one in five primary school pupils needs further support in maths , even from the fourth grade , and therefore has a slim chance of successfully passing their school leaving exams .</seg>
<seg id="31">Over fifty thousand young people drop out of school every year , without having graduated from high-school .</seg>
<seg id="32">And nineteen percent of all fifteen-year-olds don 't have the required reading skills in order to understand a simple newspaper article .</seg>
<seg id="33">This shock hit me in two thousand and six .</seg>
<seg id="34">And it was so , that a school in Berlin , a secondary school in Neukölln , the Rütli School , which some of you might have heard of , published an urgent letter .</seg>
<seg id="35">The members of staff said , that learning can no longer take place in this school , because everyday life was ruled by violence , disrespect and hopelessness .</seg>
<seg id="36">And at that exact time , I had to decide what I wanted to focus my Master 's thesis on .</seg>
<seg id="37">And somehow , I did not merely want to fabricate a scientific paper , which would then be read at most by my professor or proof-reader and that would not be of any interest to anyone .</seg>
<seg id="38">And these two issues came together and motivated me to focus my research on how education and deprived areas could be a successful concept .</seg>
<seg id="39">And then I found it in Harlem .</seg>
<seg id="40">So I came to the school and passed through the barred entrance , and I was then searched by two policemen .</seg>
<seg id="41">In the school there was great fear , that the neighbourhood drug dealers had already approached the second graders and they wanted to expand their business .</seg>
<seg id="42">I was rather shocked by that , as , of course , it was not as bad in Neukölln yet .</seg>
<seg id="43">I then went into a classroom , where a class of second graders were sitting .</seg>
<seg id="44">Twenty highly interested and concentrated faces were looking at me .</seg>
<seg id="45">Only one of them was white .</seg>
<seg id="46">In an area , where at most ten percent of the population even make it into college .</seg>
<seg id="47">How many of those then get a college degree , is a completely different question .</seg>
<seg id="48">And those twenty second graders had their sights set on one goal .</seg>
<seg id="49">And they had visually displayed this goal on their classroom wall .</seg>
<seg id="50">They had displayed the College Walk of Fame for each child .</seg>
<seg id="51">This idea was brought to them by a young teacher , who had moved to New York from Los Angeles .</seg>
<seg id="52">She knew of course of the Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles .</seg>
<seg id="53">And she worked with each child on the steps they would have to take , in order to go from the second grade in Harlem to college and graduate successfully within ten years .</seg>
<seg id="54">You should know that this class , which was only in the second grade , was already far behind in reading and arithmetic , compared to their peers in the Upper East Side in New York .</seg>
<seg id="55">Because they never got the necessary encouragement .</seg>
<seg id="56">But these children had a goal , and they knew , that they were getting the support to reach this goal , mainly from this young woman from Los Angeles .</seg>
<seg id="57">And behind this young woman stood an organisation , Teach For America , which helped her so that her class can reach this goal .</seg>
<seg id="58">This is Steffen .</seg>
<seg id="59">Steffen went to a secondary school in Baden-Württemberg .</seg>
<seg id="60">And Steffen was lucky .</seg>
<seg id="61">Not only was he highly intelligent , but he also had a teacher who recognised his potential and spoke to Steffen and his parents , about whether he had the possibility to do his school leaving exams , in order to move on from secondary school .</seg>
<seg id="62">And that is what Steffen did .</seg>
<seg id="63">It wasn 't particularly easy for him to go to a grammar school in a completely new area , surrounded by children from a completely different background .</seg>
<seg id="64">And on numerous occasions he wished he could get some information about how it was all supposed to work .</seg>
<seg id="65">How was he supposed to pass his school leaving exams ?</seg>
<seg id="66">He was successful , and he is now an engineer .</seg>
<seg id="67">He then worked for a very large German company and , among other things , set up power plants in Azerbaijan .</seg>
<seg id="68">All under his supervision .</seg>
<seg id="69">Our former secondary school pupil Steffen , from whom no one would have expected this .</seg>
<seg id="70">And after a few years in this company , Steffen decided to do something else , and applied to Teach First Germany .</seg>
<seg id="71">And he went back to a secondary school .</seg>
<seg id="72">And he stood in front of a class , which you can see down here , and Steffen thought that there is a lot more talent here , than what we had imagined .</seg>
<seg id="73">And he founded the Abi twenty fifteen Inc .</seg>
<seg id="74">In two thousand and ten he started working with a group of pupils on how they could complete their school leaving exams and start studying .</seg>
<seg id="75">And this summer he accompanied them to their secondary schools .</seg>
<seg id="76">And now Steffen is looking forward to the end of school exams celebration in two thousand and fifteen with his former students .</seg>
<seg id="77">I am sure that they will make it .</seg>
<seg id="78">This is Stefan and Fiona .</seg>
<seg id="79">Stefan is a political scientist , and Fiona is a Doctor in Mathematics .</seg>
<seg id="80">They were both placed at the same school in Wedding , in Berlin .</seg>
<seg id="81">And they both made sure , that out of the previous two out of sixty secondary school pupils taking the intermediate school-leaving examinations to have passed their maths exam , now twenty were passing .</seg>
<seg id="82">And this has led them , along with other experiences they gained during their two years of working with Teach First Germany , to now create their own school .</seg>
<seg id="83">Specifically , a private school in Wedding , where there is an approximate migrant quota of almost ninety percent and a high school graduate quota of at most ten percent .</seg>
<seg id="84">Stefan and Fiona are already working on setting up this school .</seg>
<seg id="85">And their goal is that pupils who could never in their life afford to go to a private school , would now be able to .</seg>
<seg id="86">And they make a deal from the first day with each of them , that every pupil who attends the school , will leave with a secondary school diploma .</seg>
<seg id="87">And these are the exact same students , who are currently going to school in Wedding .</seg>
<seg id="88">And I am certain , that they will both make it , even if there is a lot of work ahead of them .</seg>
<seg id="89">How did we make it possible , or how did I make this possible , for all this to happen ?</seg>
<seg id="90">I came back from the US and I was very enthusiastic about this idea and had complete faith in the fact that deprived areas and educational qualifications don 't need to be a contradiction , but an absolute possibility .</seg>
<seg id="91">And I thought that the concept which I had found , was absolutely perfect for that .</seg>
<seg id="92">So I went off and I conducted interviews with headmasters , education authorities , foundations , organisations , graduates and newspapers , to tell them about it and to infect them with my enthusiasm .</seg>
<seg id="93">I would like to tell you about only one of those many many interviews I conducted , but which I find exemplary .</seg>
<seg id="94">I was sitting with the interim headmaster of the then Rütli School in Neukölln and I told him about a fictitious Steffen and a fictitious Fiona , whom I still hadn 't met at the time , and I asked him how he would feel if such a person came to his school in two years time .</seg>
<seg id="95">And then he looked at me and said , great , fantastic , wonderful .</seg>
<seg id="96">But now , dear Mrs Landsberg , we both need to wake up , as there is no way that could happen in Germany .</seg>
<seg id="97">Firstly , you would not be able to find such a graduate , because who would be prepared to come to Neukölln for two years ?</seg>
<seg id="98">It would be complete madness , as they could do something much better with their lives .</seg>
<seg id="99">And even if you managed to persuade some of them , that it would be poss or that it would be fun , or that it would make sense , then you would never be able to get passed all the educational red tape in order to permit it .</seg>
<seg id="100">And anyways , who is going to pay for it all ?</seg>
<seg id="101">That was the starting point in two thousand and seven , when I started conducting the first interviews .</seg>
<seg id="102">And I was so convinced that this really was the right thing to do , that I said that I wouldn 't apply for a job after graduating , but I would apply for money , with which I could create a team that would be able to make this possible .</seg>
<seg id="103">And this is what we have done and achieved within two years with lots of patience and effort and lots and lots of luck .</seg>
<seg id="104">In two thousand and nine we sent the first Fellows to the schools , in Berlin , Hamburg and North Rhine-Westphalia .</seg>
<seg id="105">We not have around a hundred alumni , like Fiona and Stefan and now Steffen , who work on their own ideas on how education can be changed , or who work as executive consultants or as administrators .</seg>
<seg id="106">And now we have already chosen the fourth year group and we have nearly eighty Fellows at work in Germany .</seg>
<seg id="107">And of course , a lot of things happen to these Fellows during their work .</seg>
<seg id="108">Not only do they support their pupils , but they also undergo a change themselves .</seg>
<seg id="109">And it becomes clear to them , that these successes are possible and that the children and young people in deprived areas have so much more potential that was previously thought .</seg>
<seg id="110">And these Fellows help us to realise our vision .</seg>
<seg id="111">Every child in Germany gets to graduate from school , which then makes it possible to go through successful professional training .</seg>
<seg id="112">In every school in Germany , pupils should develop into independent young people who learn to develop their full potential , and regardless of their origin should take responsibility in society , guided by their strengths and interests .</seg>
<seg id="113">That is our goal and that is what we want to implement .</seg>
<seg id="114">Today , my role models are called Steffen or Fiona or Simon .</seg>
<seg id="115">And I want to ask you , if you would like to be such a role model as well .</seg>
<seg id="116">Thank you very much .</seg>

<seg id="1">﻿ Yes . Hello .</seg>
<seg id="2">I must say , starting off is not so easy .</seg>
<seg id="3">Well , first of all this wonderful concert , then the story , about how one comes to a crafts enterprise to the art area .</seg>
<seg id="4">I would never have thought this were a craft in the past .</seg>
<seg id="5">and now I 've come to the theme of mobility , technology , steel .</seg>
<seg id="6">So all those things we don 't consider evening entertainment in our daily lives .</seg>
<seg id="7">Actually I 'd wanted to start off on a more theoretical note .</seg>
<seg id="8">We 'll leave it out .</seg>
<seg id="9">I 've heard some of your conversations .</seg>
<seg id="10">It 's a great honour for me to be standing in front of such an audience and being allowed to speak at an event like this .</seg>
<seg id="11">Thank you again .</seg>
<seg id="12">Normally there are more technical presentations .</seg>
<seg id="13">Mobility of the future .</seg>
<seg id="14">So my introduction .</seg>
<seg id="15">I spoke to a few friends about this recently .</seg>
<seg id="16">More for fun .</seg>
<seg id="17">And there were a few really brainy people there .</seg>
<seg id="18">I 'm not being cynical , they were really brainy .</seg>
<seg id="19">Which Unlike me , that is .</seg>
<seg id="20">So what was really the greatest invention of our time and what moves us and what changes us .</seg>
<seg id="21">And we agreed on that quickly .</seg>
<seg id="22">If you go back in history .</seg>
<seg id="23">Because it will probably be something with the wheel .</seg>
<seg id="24">And with the wheel we couldn 't agree on how long that thing has actually existed .</seg>
<seg id="25">We couldn 't agree on that .</seg>
<seg id="26">One of us won .</seg>
<seg id="27">It 's only been around for about six thousand years .</seg>
<seg id="28">It 's not clear where it was first invented .</seg>
<seg id="29">But an exciting anecdote was revealed , which none of us , bar one , was familiar with .</seg>
<seg id="30">Up until the post-Columbian time , so when Columbus went to America , there had been no wheel in North America .</seg>
<seg id="31">That 's exciting when you think of the traffic situation in North America .</seg>
<seg id="32">So apparently they wanted to catch up with what they 'd not had for four thousand years in the last fifty years .</seg>
<seg id="33">I 'd like to perhaps start at the beginning with the theme mobility , energy , health , environment .</seg>
<seg id="34">Many of these themes concern us .</seg>
<seg id="35">When it comes to mobility , you often think of the car , of one 's individual mobile behaviour .</seg>
<seg id="36">But that 's not the case here .</seg>
<seg id="37">The theme mobility , personal freedom , has a narrow context .</seg>
<seg id="38">Freedom to travel , the possibility to go somewhere .</seg>
<seg id="39">Whether it 's with one 's own vehicle , with public transport , with an aeroplane or car is entirely irrelevant .</seg>
<seg id="40">It always has something to do with how advanced society is , how mature and free these individual themes are .</seg>
<seg id="41">And the other way round , even if you want to withdraw from this personally , if you say , to hell with the car , I 'll go to the next supermarket on foot , it has to be clear to you that the things in the supermarket have been delivered by train or truck .</seg>
<seg id="42">Independently of where I come from .</seg>
<seg id="43">The topic has a rather big , broad impact .</seg>
<seg id="44">And you have to confront this broad impact .</seg>
<seg id="45">It 's not enough to look at it individually .</seg>
<seg id="46">And this is exactly one of the most important points , which will be much more significant for us in the future , much more than it is at the moment .</seg>
<seg id="47">An important point here is , to just show one example .</seg>
<seg id="48">It already depends very strongly on how we move about .</seg>
<seg id="49">And not so much on what the machine uses up .</seg>
<seg id="50">At the moment the mantra is along the lines of using up as little as possible when making a car .</seg>
<seg id="51">Or the change to electromobility in the first place , which cannot be objected to .</seg>
<seg id="52">But if you , let 's take an example here , CO two , which everybody is talking about and is currently being discussed intensively in Europe and is being implemented by the legislature .</seg>
<seg id="53">Then you 'd be at about seventy percent with a fuel or petrol engine , in terms of the car 's use , during its lifespan , the amount of CO two it emits .</seg>
<seg id="54">Twenty five percent goes to the manufacture of the car .</seg>
<seg id="55">So about half , let 's say .</seg>
<seg id="56">Let 's not look at it in such detail .</seg>
<seg id="57">There 's no need for that .</seg>
<seg id="58">Five percent is basically if you re-use everything .</seg>
<seg id="59">If you 'd calculate that for an electric car , it would look very different .</seg>
<seg id="60">With an electric car you 'd just have twenty five percent , as long as you 're generating electricity with coal , which the car emits because of the wave of energy , but you have well over fifty percent in terms of production .</seg>
<seg id="61">From the batteries , the electric motors and all those things .</seg>
<seg id="62">And if we don 't start looking at this entire cycle , we may feel relief to some extent , but we will shift the problem .</seg>
<seg id="63">We will shift the problem to production and , from there , even outside of Europe possibly .</seg>
<seg id="64">That 's why it 's very important to consider that the point is how sustainable production is , how sustainable the products are and how sustainable the materials you make all these things from are .</seg>
<seg id="65">And this is where , mind you , a material comes into play , which , between quotation marks , affects me personally and intensely , and that 's the topic of steel .</seg>
<seg id="66">In itself , this is nothing new or sophistic .</seg>
<seg id="67">And in many cases one thinks , what can still be of any interest there ?</seg>
<seg id="68">This is a very special background .</seg>
<seg id="69">There is hardly any area of mobility which is not strongly saturated .</seg>
<seg id="70">Whether it 's public transport , the railways , electric motors , whatever .</seg>
<seg id="71">An important point is that if we manage to really recycle everything , we will generate a resource cycle , in contrast to other materials , that is really one hundred percent closed .</seg>
<seg id="72">Steel , every car , every aeroplane , fifteen percent of an aeroplane is made of steels , will be able to be recycled with the same quality .</seg>
<seg id="73">That means I can always make the same thing from it again and again .</seg>
<seg id="74">This can be done with other materials too , but usually not one hundred percent .</seg>
<seg id="75">You always have to add something to it .</seg>
<seg id="76">If we manage to use up less and recycle more , we 'll be able to gain a lot here , because every time you disintegrate something and somehow process it you also use up energy and other things .</seg>
<seg id="77">And that 's one of the main themes .</seg>
<seg id="78">And like I said in the beginning , it 's the theme of material and these are the themes of this new time which are coming to us , which will affect every one of us very strongly , and which will already gives us possibilities that we didn 't have some years ago .</seg>
<seg id="79">Who of you could imagine twenty years ago standing in Vienna , checking your mobile phone to see if there was some car-to-go or some other car in the area , going there , getting in the car , driving two kilometres and then getting out again ?</seg>
<seg id="80">It would have been unimaginable .</seg>
<seg id="81">The car is not even different .</seg>
<seg id="82">The Electrosmart or Dieselsmart car that 's standing around is basically still .</seg>
<seg id="83">These are things that have just now started to be put into operation .</seg>
<seg id="84">They 're on the rise just now .</seg>
<seg id="85">There are many more possibilities here .</seg>
<seg id="86">The possibility to get into the car from the bus , onto a bicycle from the car , and onto an aeroplane from the bicycle .</seg>
<seg id="87">It would already be possible now to have the transport mode of my choice for individual traffic , exactly at the moment when I need it .</seg>
<seg id="88">The only condition is that everyone makes a contribution and invests something in this .</seg>
<seg id="89">There are a number of things here that may seem incredible to some people , because our ability to adapt is so slow .</seg>
<seg id="90">An automobile like that is really a never-ending story of mistakes .</seg>
<seg id="91">If you can imagine Gottfried Daimler with his wife , I think , it was in eighteen hundred ninety-two or etcetera he built the first car .</seg>
<seg id="92">That was a little wooden coach with an engine at the back .</seg>
<seg id="93">The reason why this little engine was at the back was that if it stopped working you could attach horses at the front .</seg>
<seg id="94">It took fifteen years for the first car to be built with an engine at the front .</seg>
<seg id="95">It took fifteen years before we were no longer afraid that we might need the horses at the front .</seg>
<seg id="96">Now I don 't want to go back to digital media and ask you how old Google and co. is .</seg>
<seg id="97">But it takes a while for us to adapt .</seg>
<seg id="98">And the same applies here .</seg>
<seg id="99">But we can increase this speed of adaption .</seg>
<seg id="100">And we should increase it .</seg>
<seg id="101">Because otherwise we won 't get a grip on the problems .</seg>
<seg id="102">Especially because mobility cannot be slowed down .</seg>
<seg id="103">Now you can say that it will go down a little in Europe .</seg>
<seg id="104">And it is , in private transport .</seg>
<seg id="105">But it 's doing so half as much in goods traffic .</seg>
<seg id="106">Every order made at Amazon , every online shop that travels up in the air somewhere , has an incredibly long logistics chain that gets one truck after the other , one train after the other moving .</seg>
<seg id="107">And now you could say , okay , I could buy less online and I could stop using these things .</seg>
<seg id="108">But that won 't happen .</seg>
<seg id="109">You know that you only change when you 're put under extreme psychological pressure .</seg>
<seg id="110">Very rarely does one do so voluntarily .</seg>
<seg id="111">Well , I don 't know anyone who fundamentally changed themselves voluntarily .</seg>
<seg id="112">And that 's why it 's so important to use all the possibilities that are there .</seg>
<seg id="113">And to try out and do these things .</seg>
<seg id="114">Things take a long time sometimes .</seg>
<seg id="115">But a topic we should be proud of .</seg>
<seg id="116">And I have three kids .</seg>
<seg id="117">Luckily they 're not here , because they wouldn 't sit here so well-behaved .</seg>
<seg id="118">And be so kind as to support me .</seg>
<seg id="119">They would say very different things .</seg>
<seg id="120">You 'd laugh at that point too , but I wouldn 't .</seg>
<seg id="121">But when I 'm an old fart one day and they look back on the time when I was able to change something in my company , they will ask themselves whether I was proud of this time or not .</seg>
<seg id="122">And this means we want to guarantee full mobility and we want to leave behind a fully intact planet .</seg>
<seg id="123">And those are the two things that can be changed .</seg>
<seg id="124">Independently of what side you 're looking at the whole thing from .</seg>
<seg id="125">The reason that that 's so important is that we have a certain amount of materials at our disposal and we will be getting a certain amount of new materials .</seg>
<seg id="126">There 's no question about it .</seg>
<seg id="127">Because we don 't have enough of all these materials at our disposal .</seg>
<seg id="128">That 's like if I would say that I 'm in a lightweight construction and there are amazingly great new materials like carbon .</seg>
<seg id="129">If you can create those with hydraulic power , they 're theoretically also environmentally friendly .</seg>
<seg id="130">Problematically we will never have a triple excess of energy on this planet , which would enable us to build practically everything out of carbon .</seg>
<seg id="131">So everything has its pros and cons and only a good connection between these topics will help us .</seg>
<seg id="132">Two years ago first developments were being made in the welding of steel and aluminium .</seg>
<seg id="133">The word didn 't exist .</seg>
<seg id="134">Twenty years ago nobody was doing research into that .</seg>
<seg id="135">It was like , why ? You don 't really need that .</seg>
<seg id="136">It will only be overly expensive and not help us in any way .</seg>
<seg id="137">And the same goes for high velocity and other issues .</seg>
<seg id="138">We have examples here already , of things that weren 't possible in the past that are now possible and they are less than three years old .</seg>
<seg id="139">And that 's one of the most important points that I 'd like to pass on to you here .</seg>
<seg id="140">Because everybody can do something .</seg>
<seg id="141">And with that I don 't mean I 'm going to the supermarket on foot now to buy plums from Venezuela .</seg>
<seg id="142">But everybody can pay attention in his profession to how they can , on the one hand , guarantee that mobility , which we all deserve and worked hard for , is limited just a little and how can I , through that , stimulate other things .</seg>
<seg id="143">I 'll give you an example with the Swiss railways , which some of you will probably know .</seg>
<seg id="144">The Gotthardtunnel has been in construction since nineteen ninety eight , ninety nine , I think .</seg>
<seg id="145">They 're digging fifty seven kilometres into the mountain .</seg>
<seg id="146">It will be completed in two thousand seventeen .</seg>
<seg id="147">This tunnel through the mountain will shorten the travel time between Zurich and Milan by one hour .</seg>
<seg id="148">Together with the other tunnels that pass through there they will gather up a speed of two hundred and fifty KPH .</seg>
<seg id="149">And that 's only possible because they 're on high-speed rails that have a surface that is twice as strong .</seg>
<seg id="150">Because you can 't change the rails every five years in a tunnel , like you can out in the open .</seg>
<seg id="151">And it all happens electrified .</seg>
<seg id="152">That means you 'll get into a situation where you 'll not destroy the landscape with electric drive in tunnels or other areas , and yet you 'll be as fast as aeroplane .</seg>
<seg id="153">Because by the time it 's over the mountains in Zurich and back down again in Milan , if they ever get there and nobody 's striking , you will have arrived there by train twice already .</seg>
<seg id="154">You won 't need to check in and take off your shoes at the station .</seg>
<seg id="155">So there are already possibilities that are in there .</seg>
<seg id="156">And you mustn 't make the mistake of always just filtering out one slice .</seg>
<seg id="157">One single slice won 't get us anywhere .</seg>
<seg id="158">It won 't help us .</seg>
<seg id="159">To give you an example , that 's a security issue .</seg>
<seg id="160">We 're already working on intelligent materials , so-called intelligent steel .</seg>
<seg id="161">That 's nothing but , if you imagine this vision .</seg>
<seg id="162">You all know airbags and other things in your car that can prevent you , hopefully prevent you , from hurting yourself badly and even from dying .</seg>
<seg id="163">Now think what it would mean if it wasn 't the airbag , but the car itself .</seg>
<seg id="164">If the car body were able to change its material structure in such a way that it becomes very hard very quickly and then soft again the moment it notices that it 's going to crash into something .</seg>
<seg id="165">We 're already working on developing this structure in such a way that it already changes mechanically .</seg>
<seg id="166">That means it changes .</seg>
<seg id="167">If it gets into a crash , it notices it needs energy and the material changes .</seg>
<seg id="168">In South Korea , that was a good example , in Seoul , there were deflectors that are two hundred and fifty kilometres long .</seg>
<seg id="169">They have an extremely well-developed railway network over there .</seg>
<seg id="170">The frog turnouts are self-curing in the middle over there .</seg>
<seg id="171">Well , that 's the part that wears down most .</seg>
<seg id="172">Every time a train rides over it , it gets harder .</seg>
<seg id="173">That means it tries to work against the circuit .</seg>
<seg id="174">This was a development that took eight and a half years .</seg>
<seg id="175">Four people worked on it .</seg>
<seg id="176">Goods , I think , don 't know how much money was put into it , not much .</seg>
<seg id="177">And it was a really big issue .</seg>
<seg id="178">And the other issues are .</seg>
<seg id="179">Even if you just say you could develop material where you need less material , which is lighter and harder .</seg>
<seg id="180">So-called press hardening of steels won 't mean anything to you now .</seg>
<seg id="181">I had a few examples hung up outside .</seg>
<seg id="182">Those are things that improve safety .</seg>
<seg id="183">They reduce the weight .</seg>
<seg id="184">By between forty and one hundred kilos .</seg>
<seg id="185">A comparison , forty to one hundred kilos , the Golf seven was just released , that means about zero point four litres less consumption .</seg>
<seg id="186">For the entire life cycle , with an average driver , that means three million tons CO two .</seg>
<seg id="187">Three million tons CO two , just because this clunker , between quotation marks , I mean , this beautiful car , excuse me for this expression , simple has forty kilos less or one hundred kilos less .</seg>
<seg id="188">And then you take cars of which a few million are built every year .</seg>
<seg id="189">You will know that we have fourteen million cars in Europe .</seg>
<seg id="190">We have sixteen in North America and China has also reached the fifteen million mark .</seg>
<seg id="191">Think of the crank you still have inside it , if you want to add something on this side here .</seg>
<seg id="192">And these are the things where , in each individual case , we look at whether it can be changed , whether it can be improved , whether it can be looked into again .</seg>
<seg id="193">Whether we can make it from the material side in such a way , but if so , do the other thing too and one can link it up tighter , then we will find solutions that we don 't even dare to think up yet .</seg>
<seg id="194">Like colleagues of mine wouldn 't have up with the idea ten years ago , that there are railway tracks today that can support a speed of three hundred and eighty KPH in China .</seg>
<seg id="195">And they 're operating .</seg>
<seg id="196">And these are things that weren 't imaginable .</seg>
<seg id="197">And why is that important ?</seg>
<seg id="198">I mean , will China have such a big need for poor farmers who travel at three hundred and eighty KPH .</seg>
<seg id="199">No , because over there , there is the possibility that the train will lead the aircraft to stay on the ground .</seg>
<seg id="200">Now I 'm not against the aviation industry , but it is a more efficient possibility in some areas .</seg>
<seg id="201">And five , six years ago that still wasn 't imaginable .</seg>
<seg id="202">And , to finish off .</seg>
<seg id="203">The most important area and the message in all of these individual projects is that we must start looking at the entire valued added chain and the entire life cycle .</seg>
<seg id="204">There 's no sense in me saying I need less energy or that doesn 't cost me anything , but the thing that needs less energy is extremely complex , consumes a lot of resources , uses a lot of energy and may not even be recycled .</seg>
<seg id="205">There are parts of Nevada where a thousand aircrafts stand .</seg>
<seg id="206">In these thousand aircrafts are million of tons of silver , gold and other things .</seg>
<seg id="207">There is no technology that can recycle them properly .</seg>
<seg id="208">And if you activate this recycling mode , you can make incredible things happen .</seg>
<seg id="209">And I think that 's one of the most important messages if we manage to do that , the recycling theme , if we take a closer look at the materials we work with , and not only the work conditions , what kind of global impact does it have ?</seg>
<seg id="210">What does it do with it ?</seg>
<seg id="211">Under us there are irons in the crust of the earth , which has an iron core , you will find plenty of it .</seg>
<seg id="212">It 's problematic if you say , it 's exactly under this spot here , then we clear up the area and start digging into it .</seg>
<seg id="213">So it doesn 't have to also be rare for one to think about how to excavate it ?</seg>
<seg id="214">And it is exactly this commitment of every individual to look at every single part and to do this collectively , that would be my personal vision and my wish for the future .</seg>
<seg id="215">And that 's why I 'd also like to thank you for your .</seg>
<seg id="216">Thank you .</seg>

<doc docid="E04_Energie-bewegt-die-Welt-Susanna" genre="lectures">
<talkid>E04_Energie-bewegt-die-Welt-Susanna</talkid>
<seg id="1">Right , I wish you a lovely afternoon .</seg>
<seg id="2">I 'm here today to tell you why energy moves the world .</seg>
<seg id="3">The previous speaker painted an impressive picture of what we can do with mobility today and what we 'll be needing in the future , to further improve the living standards we are used to having .</seg>
<seg id="4">We live in a beautiful world really . a world in which one point six billion people live without electricity .</seg>
<seg id="5">Day after day .</seg>
<seg id="6">If you look at the figures , at how humanity has developed over the last decades , you will find some very interesting facts .</seg>
<seg id="7">In this chart here you can see how the world population has developed over the last years .</seg>
<seg id="8">While it was one billion people in eighteen hundred , today just under seven billion people live on the planet .</seg>
<seg id="9">Today , eighty three million people are born every year on this planet , and every day it 's just under two hundred and thirty million people .</seg>
<seg id="10">And in the time I 've been standing on this stage , one hundred and fifty eight people have been born .</seg>
<seg id="11">And per second two point six to three people are born .</seg>
<seg id="12">People who need energy .</seg>
<seg id="13">And if you look at that , at how this has developed in the course of time , then you will come to the conclusion that about two hundred and fifty million people have been born into this world , on this planet , in one thousand six hundred and fifty years .</seg>
<seg id="14">And in the two hundred years that followed it was five hundred people .</seg>
<seg id="15">And if you look at the next eighty years , it was one billion .</seg>
<seg id="16">Then in the next forty years it would be two billion and in the last thirty nine years four billion .</seg>
<seg id="17">And if it goes on like this , we 'll have to seriously ask ourselves where this energy is supposed to come from .</seg>
<seg id="18">Especially if you take into account the one point six billion people who still don 't have electricity .</seg>
<seg id="19">And taking into account the emerging and developing countries that by far do not consume the same amount of energy that we in Europe or in the Western world do .</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at the energy graphic at the same time , then you 'll see this image .</seg>
<seg id="21">An image that illustrates that energy consumption has doubled in the last forty years .</seg>
<seg id="22">And if you take a closer look , these are all fossil fuels .</seg>
<seg id="23">This is an image that depicts the world population and energy .</seg>
<seg id="24">The lower line , the more evenly ascending line shows how the world population has developed .</seg>
<seg id="25">And the more steeply ascending line represents the energy consumption .</seg>
<seg id="26">That means that if you just look at the last fifty years , you had two point five times more energy increase than people on this Earth .</seg>
<seg id="27">That presents us with the second problem .</seg>
<seg id="28">Is the rising world population the issue or is it the energy issue or the balance in-between ?</seg>
<seg id="29">What do we need this energy for ?</seg>
<seg id="30">There are three basic reasons .</seg>
<seg id="31">One of them , as the speaker before me already mentioned , is traffic .</seg>
<seg id="32">We need more than thirty percent for traffic .</seg>
<seg id="33">For logistics , for the transport of ourselves and all the goods and services we need .</seg>
<seg id="34">The next thirty percent , I mean twenty seven , just under thirty percent , is used for industry .</seg>
<seg id="35">To produce those goods that we consume day after day .</seg>
<seg id="36">And the final third approximately , so just under twenty five percent , goes to all our households .</seg>
<seg id="37">That means that every one of us , so all people who live in a household in this world , consume approximately on third of the world 's energy .</seg>
<seg id="38">And how do we consume it ?</seg>
<seg id="39">These are amazing figures .</seg>
<seg id="40">Just under eighty percent , to be more precise , it 's seventy eight percent that is used for heating .</seg>
<seg id="41">Another eleven percent comes from the issue of hot water , and the rest is electricity for TV , fridge and those sorts of things .</seg>
<seg id="42">That 's just a fraction actually .</seg>
<seg id="43">So a good ninety percent of all that 's consumed in the household is heat and hot water .</seg>
<seg id="44">And if you now look at building construction technology in the last years , you 'll see that we 've been putting a lot of effort into decreasing this type of energy consumption .</seg>
<seg id="45">The red lines show how much we consume for heating with different types of energy .</seg>
<seg id="46">The first bar represents the buildings we have in the world at the moment .</seg>
<seg id="47">And on the far right you have the passive house .</seg>
<seg id="48">And in-between you see a few variants .</seg>
<seg id="49">And here you can see that from the existing standard buildings to the passive house heat consumption must be reduced considerably .</seg>
<seg id="50">And the journey hasn 't come to an end yet .</seg>
<seg id="51">The future should go in the direction where the house itself consumes the energy .</seg>
<seg id="52">A house that supplies energy for the network , so that others can use it .</seg>
<seg id="53">The question is , the energy that we consume , what does that consist of .</seg>
<seg id="54">And here you 'll see a very shocking picture .</seg>
<seg id="55">Just under ninety percent of this energy is generated from coal , gas or oil .</seg>
<seg id="56">That means we 're living in a fossil fuel era .</seg>
<seg id="57">With all the modern things we have , the smartphones and iPads and whatever .</seg>
<seg id="58">We 're in this fossil fuel era .</seg>
<seg id="59">In a era , where ninety percent of the energy we consume comes from oil , gas and coal .</seg>
<seg id="60">And these forms of energy are very limited .</seg>
<seg id="61">Five percent of the energy comes from nuclear power .</seg>
<seg id="62">Nuclear energy , which is known because of Chernobyl and similar incidents .</seg>
<seg id="63">A ticking bomb basically .</seg>
<seg id="64">And only very little , just under seven percent in this world , comes from energy that we have the most of .</seg>
<seg id="65">And I 'd like to take a closer look at that now .</seg>
<seg id="66">What energy is it ?</seg>
<seg id="67">Now before I get to that , I would like to show you what the situation is with the fossil energy resources .</seg>
<seg id="68">What will our future look like if we continue to rely on them ?</seg>
<seg id="69">And here I have a graphic that shows how many years our supply of uranium for the nuclear plants , of petroleum gas and crude oil will last .</seg>
<seg id="70">And there you see that uranium , petroleum gas and coal , are roughly equal , they will last for just under another fifty years .</seg>
<seg id="71">And then these resources will have been exhausted .</seg>
<seg id="72">I know that these figures change from year to year .</seg>
<seg id="73">And oil companies are always telling us that the technologies are always getting better and new sources have been found and all that .</seg>
<seg id="74">But whether fossil fuels will be around for another forty or sixty years is irrelevant .</seg>
<seg id="75">What is relevant is that they are coming to an end .</seg>
<seg id="76">An end that is inevitable , because of the available resources .</seg>
<seg id="77">And the answer we have to come up with is how we will continue when that happens .</seg>
<seg id="78">Will we be able to continue using our smartphones , and all these things we enjoy having so much today , with our cars , and just continue as if nothing had happened , and keep our living standards upright in the form that is has now ?</seg>
<seg id="79">The answer is yes , we can .</seg>
<seg id="80">And the reason for that is the following .</seg>
<seg id="81">Here you 'll see what primary energy demand there is from photovoltaics , hydraulic energy , biomass , wave and sea energy and wind parks .</seg>
<seg id="82">At the top right , this big box , that 's the photovoltaic potential or solar energy potential , which we have at our disposal on this planet .</seg>
<seg id="83">And this little dot her , this one here , I don 't know whether you can see it , this little dot , that represents the annual world energy consumption .</seg>
<seg id="84">Down here , world energy consumption .</seg>
<seg id="85">You can hardly see it it 's so small .</seg>
<seg id="86">And these other spheres , that are down , this this here is solar energy .</seg>
<seg id="87">Here you can see the potential we have with wind energy .</seg>
<seg id="88">This box here .</seg>
<seg id="89">This box represents wave and sea energy .</seg>
<seg id="90">This box represents biomass .</seg>
<seg id="91">And this here is water , the hydraulic energy potential .</seg>
<seg id="92">And here we see the small consumption that we need , the energy that we need .</seg>
<seg id="93">Actually this graphic shows that we have enough energy .</seg>
<seg id="94">Except that at the moment we 're relying perhaps on the wrong kind of energy .</seg>
<seg id="95">The graphic below contains the same box .</seg>
<seg id="96">But here we see the coal , crude oil and uranium potential .</seg>
<seg id="97">So basically we could have enough energy .</seg>
<seg id="98">We have a hydraulic energy potential .</seg>
<seg id="99">If we would use the entire potential of hydraulic energy we have , it would make itself available for half of the world energy consumption .</seg>
<seg id="100">We have sixteen times the world energy consumption with the biomass potential .</seg>
<seg id="101">With wave and sea energy the potential is eighty times the world energy consumption .</seg>
<seg id="102">Wind energy potential lies at three hundred and twenty five times the world energy consumption .</seg>
<seg id="103">And solar energy potential is six thousand times higher than the world energy consumption .</seg>
<seg id="104">That means we needn 't be worried about whether we will have energy in the future .</seg>
<seg id="105">What we should be worrying about is whether we humans will get out of this fossil era soon enough and will develop into the future we need .</seg>
<seg id="106">There are two variants here in my opinion .</seg>
<seg id="107">The first variant is So this chart here depicts the years one thousand to three thousand .</seg>
<seg id="108">And there you see that humans started out with wood with fire .</seg>
<seg id="109">Then we had the first windmills .</seg>
<seg id="110">And at some point the fossil fuel era arrived , and that increased slowly .</seg>
<seg id="111">We are now at this point here .</seg>
<seg id="112">Nuclear energy also came into the picture .</seg>
<seg id="113">And now there are two scenarios .</seg>
<seg id="114">The first scenario is that we are aware of what these fossil fuels mean to our climate , and we voluntarily abandon them .</seg>
<seg id="115">That means the curve will rapidly go down .</seg>
<seg id="116">Or it happens a good hundred , two hundred years later , fifty to one hundred years later , and we back out of it a lot later , because we no longer have the resources in that form .</seg>
<seg id="117">And so we have this spectrum , where we can decide where we will be .</seg>
<seg id="118">Possibly in the middle , possibly right at the front .</seg>
<seg id="119">Time will tell .</seg>
<seg id="120">And after that will come era , where technologies like wind , like solar energy will simply be there and will expand .</seg>
<seg id="121">A renewable energy era .</seg>
<seg id="122">How quickly we 'll allow for this to arrive depends on us humans .</seg>
<seg id="123">And so like I showed you the chart earlier on , how at the moment ninety percent comes from fossil fuels and only ten from other renewables , it might be the exact reverse situation in the year two thousand and fifty or the year two thousand one hundred .</seg>
<seg id="124">That ninety percent comes from renewables and ten percent from fossil fuels .</seg>
<seg id="125">The energy demand will continue to rise .</seg>
<seg id="126">Mobility demands will continue to rise .</seg>
<seg id="127">New things will be invented that each of us want , as was the case in the last decades .</seg>
<seg id="128">And that means energy consumption will continue to rise .</seg>
<seg id="129">But we have to ask ourselves in what way it will rise .</seg>
<seg id="130">Is the way we use energy efficient enough ?</seg>
<seg id="131">Are we saving wherever we can save ?</seg>
<seg id="132">Do our homes still represent a third of the energy that is consumed , or is that no longer the case ?</seg>
<seg id="133">Or do our homes perhaps produce something ?</seg>
<seg id="134">And the question that crops up here is what does this picture , this new picture , this new solution look like .</seg>
<seg id="135">Just like there are smartphones and smart cars , there will also be smart cities .</seg>
<seg id="136">Because a good half of the world population currently live in cities .</seg>
<seg id="137">And in the year two thousand and fifty it will be seventy percent of all humans that live in cities .</seg>
<seg id="138">And that will amount to about six and a half billion people .</seg>
<seg id="139">So just under the number of people that currently live on this planet will be living in cities at that time .</seg>
<seg id="140">And we will need solutions for these issues .</seg>
<seg id="141">Solutions for creating a smart city , for creating many smart cities so that we 'll live on a smart planet .</seg>
<seg id="142">And then it will be necessary to look at topics such as smart mobility , smart government , smart environment , smart living and smart economy .</seg>
<seg id="143">For us to be able to do that , the most important thing will be that we humans become smart people .</seg>
<seg id="144">Because only then will it be possible to continue to move along with such a development .</seg>
<seg id="145">So each one of us can start with themselves .</seg>
<seg id="146">Thank you .</seg>

<talkid>E05_Ein-Medium-fr-die-die-sonst-kei</talkid>
<seg id="1">Can you hear me ?</seg>
<seg id="2">Yes , hello .</seg>
<seg id="3">To refer to Professor Grün , although I spray graffiti , I 'm interested in art and design .</seg>
<seg id="4">My topic this evening is undesired communication , analogue responses to campaigns and a medium for those who otherwise have none .</seg>
<seg id="5">The latter was a quote from the Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung about graffiti or style writing in Frankfurt .</seg>
<seg id="6">In the beginning , there was the image .</seg>
<seg id="7">At least descriptive , as can be proven today , the first communicative proof of humans are the cave paintings , which is graffiti really .</seg>
<seg id="8">In my opinion they were schools .</seg>
<seg id="9">I mean , I think that ancient folks or peoples had to think more pragmatically and that 's why they didn 't make any religious pictures , just wall paintings that explained where the animals walked along or where or how one could kill a bison , where one had to strike to make a mammoth fall over .</seg>
<seg id="10">And the whole thing , which I want to make cross-reference to tonight , is of course extremely important , because , as Frank Zappa once said , talking about music is like dancing about architecture .</seg>
<seg id="11">It 's extremely difficult .</seg>
<seg id="12">Style writing is a huge field , an enormous movement , which affects people from all age groups all over the world today .</seg>
<seg id="13">So you can no longer say that 's it 's purely a youth movement , as it 's already become a fixed cultural element .</seg>
<seg id="14">As with many things , in science too , style writing or graffiti , I will explain the difference in a moment , is all about recognition .</seg>
<seg id="15">And I 'd like to quote the brain researcher Joachim Bauer here .</seg>
<seg id="16">Nothing activates the motivation system in the brain so much as the desire to be seen by others .</seg>
<seg id="17">And that 's exactly the principle behind style writing , graffiti and also advertising .</seg>
<seg id="18">The generic term graffiti .</seg>
<seg id="19">Can we move on with the charts ?</seg>
<seg id="20">I think the thirty seconds are over .</seg>
<seg id="21">Style writing is the liberation of the alphabet .</seg>
<seg id="22">Oh right , I have to do that myself .</seg>
<seg id="23">Sorry , thanks .</seg>
<seg id="24">Great , sorry .</seg>
<seg id="25">Style writing is the American variant of graffiti , which is primarily focused on letters .</seg>
<seg id="26">That means the aesthetisation of the alphabet , the liberation of the alphabet from information content to pure design , which contends with the other .</seg>
<seg id="27">It 's all about dynamics in style .</seg>
<seg id="28">It 's about an achievement principle .</seg>
<seg id="29">It is , you might say , actually</seg>
<seg id="30">What 's dripping here ?</seg>
<seg id="31">Something 's dripping here , I 'm not joking .</seg>
<seg id="32">Whatever .</seg>
<seg id="33">It 's all about the achievement principle .</seg>
<seg id="34">That means sprayers compete with each other in a reasonably peaceful way , they contend with each other through peaceful aesthetics , through these stylistics , and this is an early work by myself , this is a newer one .</seg>
<seg id="35">It 's a form of communication on another level , you might say , as it always is with artistic expression .</seg>
<seg id="36">Not everything that takes place in the public space is an artistic expression , I admit .</seg>
<seg id="37">The second point is street art which can be seen in the graffiti scene .</seg>
<seg id="38">Street art is a consequence of style writing .</seg>
<seg id="39">There are figures that exist as decorative elements in the styles , they are these fonts that have become independent .</seg>
<seg id="40">And additionally , there are the stencil artists .</seg>
<seg id="41">These are people like Blek le Rat from Paris or Banksy , who has become more well-known recently .</seg>
<seg id="42">While style writing is the American graffiti that tends to be free of any topic and doesn 't point a finger at social issues , you could say , the works by stencil or street artists can be seen as having more of an advertising quality or , yes , point a finger at social issues , so it 's tainted with social issues .</seg>
<seg id="43">Style writing is not anarchy though , despite everything , but follows a a non-commercial parallel hierarchy that has its own values and judgements in the public and private sphere , which are the transmission spaces , you might say .</seg>
<seg id="44">I 'd like to quote the philosopher Paul Watzlawick at this point .</seg>
<seg id="45">One cannot not communicate .</seg>
<seg id="46">And that goes for style writing too of course .</seg>
<seg id="47">It 's a struggle for recognition .</seg>
<seg id="48">It 's a struggle for communication , that can be seen , you might say , as an indicator too , or rather a muffler for social problems .</seg>
<seg id="49">Graffiti is often found as a culture that won 't grow up in depictions in the media .</seg>
<seg id="50">It came about in the sixties but it 's always renewing itself and so I believe it 's a fixed part of culture .</seg>
<seg id="51">I created the artwork for the Ted X on the side here .</seg>
<seg id="52">It 's a bit abstract , but that 's also a style , as we say , that 's a bit complaisant .</seg>
<seg id="53">It 's also decorative .</seg>
<seg id="54">So you see that the spray can is not only able to bring events into being .</seg>
<seg id="55">You can look at it in whatever way you wish .</seg>
<seg id="56">Perhaps that ’ s also damage to property .</seg>
<seg id="57">To look at the Internet culture in parallel , we have this pseudonymisation , if I may call it that , in style writing too .</seg>
<seg id="58">On the Internet we have these avatars .</seg>
<seg id="59">And these days we also have , and of course it 's also about recognition and self-marketing , about posing there .</seg>
<seg id="60">I think it would be good , if we want to deal with these topics more openly in the future , if cities , municipalities and also institutions would familiarise themselves with this subject .</seg>
<seg id="61">The hand that the pedagogically educated style writers , of which there are a number today , are stretching out to the institutions too should be accepted .</seg>
<seg id="62">One should illustrate that the cultural aspect has existed for over forty years here and that it must simply yes , really be kept alive .</seg>
<seg id="63">So , what we show , I run workshops myself .</seg>
<seg id="64">I just have to turn around for a moment .</seg>
<seg id="65">By the way , some of these works were made by me , some by other people .</seg>
<seg id="66">Of course I try to pass on this knowledge that I gathered myself or that I sometimes gained from other style writers .</seg>
<seg id="67">My work has turned me into my own brand over time and I 've asserted that the German word for brand , Marke , is based on the German verb markieren , to mark .</seg>
<seg id="68">Of course this also has to do with the relationship to property , but the overriding thing is that that 's not so important anymore .</seg>
<seg id="69">Where are we , where are we .</seg>
<seg id="70">Oh right , okay .</seg>
<seg id="71">Something that happens quite often these days , which I personally don 't like that much .</seg>
<seg id="72">Here you can see a workshop for the Aktion Mensch charity , for example .</seg>
<seg id="73">What I don 't think is so great is that , power companies , for example , try to stem the problematics of illegal graffiti through a kind of kitschy preventive painting , I 'll just call it that , where it 's about aesthetisations that are based on pure technique , but don 't do justice to style writing .</seg>
<seg id="74">So here the concept of freedom of opinion is curtailed a bit .</seg>
<seg id="75">I don 't want to go into this in any more detail , as that would be going too far .</seg>
<seg id="76">The subject has a really large scope and cannot be completely explained in ten or fifteen minutes .</seg>
<seg id="77">I just want to say that he who writes , remains .</seg>
<seg id="78">That 's a terrible word really , but , in the end , what Professor Grün said is also a lie in itself of course .</seg>
<seg id="79">Sure , if you dare to move in an environment outside of the law and operate in the public and private sphere with a spray can , then you 're aware of your own transitory nature .</seg>
<seg id="80">You know that you 're only here for a short time and you know that time is the only thing you really possess .</seg>
<seg id="81">To finish off , I 'd just like to mention something Franz Kafka had to say about this .</seg>
<seg id="82">Anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty never grows old .</seg>
<seg id="83">A funny thing in this context is that you 'll find the Schiele Museum where Tulln district court was once housed , which is where Franz Kafka had to appear on a number of occasions , because of accusations of indecency in his works .</seg>
<seg id="84">Yes , I 'd like to thank you .</seg>
<seg id="85">Have a good evening .</seg>

<talkid>E06_Nach-und-doch-so-Fern-Thomas-Mo</talkid>
<seg id="1">﻿ Yes , the topic is , close but yet so far .</seg>
<seg id="2">What do Olympic athletes actually do , besides competing in the Olympic Games .</seg>
<seg id="3">Actually , it comes down to ,</seg>
<seg id="4">in principle .</seg>
<seg id="5">Because we must imagine that there is a four-year period between two such summer Games , and these four years are almost exactly to the day .</seg>
<seg id="6">Sometimes there are five days less , and sometimes more .</seg>
<seg id="7">But usually , they take place every four years to the day .</seg>
<seg id="8">This year , there were approximately ten thousand five hundred and ninety two athletes there , including all the substitutes and nominated replacement athletes and so on .</seg>
<seg id="9">And , as you have already realised , there is a large range of emotions there , and not only due to the sports , yes .</seg>
<seg id="10">Olympic athletes , you really have to understand this , train for four years for this .</seg>
<seg id="11">You have to be highly concentrated .</seg>
<seg id="12">You have to do all the preparations .</seg>
<seg id="13">You have to forget about everything else .</seg>
<seg id="14">You have to forget about parties .</seg>
<seg id="15">You have to forget about your studies .</seg>
<seg id="16">You have to forget about your relationship .</seg>
<seg id="17">You have to forget about your family .</seg>
<seg id="18">You have to forget about Christmas .</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to forget about food .</seg>
<seg id="20">Sleep .</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact , the only thing you do is train , train , talk with your trainer about what you can improve during training , talk with your coach , who is normally in charge of mental training .</seg>
<seg id="22">What can I improve , in order to become even better ?</seg>
<seg id="23">And train .</seg>
<seg id="24">That is actually your main preoccupation for four years , and then you say , yes , I 'm going there now .</seg>
<seg id="25">I have done it , I have been nominated .</seg>
<seg id="26">And then .</seg>
<seg id="27">I am mentally fit and I swim my one hundred metre front crawl in this pool , and after forty nine seconds I get to the other side , that was the only competition for which I qualified and then I realise , great , it is all done .</seg>
<seg id="28">It is all over .</seg>
<seg id="29">this happened a lot to the Germans this year , because they said ,</seg>
<seg id="30">enough .</seg>
<seg id="31">Everyone can swim several times .</seg>
<seg id="32">The Americans do it , the Australians and the British do it , the Japanese , the Chinese , they can do it all much better .</seg>
<seg id="33">The whole swimming-several-times thing , we simply can 't do it .</seg>
<seg id="34">And then some of this pressure is lifted off .</seg>
<seg id="35">You are there on duty for two weeks .</seg>
<seg id="36">Yes and now one can say , that it is a great holiday program .</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately , this is not the case .</seg>
<seg id="38">Unfortunately , the cultural program is very limited .</seg>
<seg id="39">There are only competitions .</seg>
<seg id="40">And there is a big cafeteria .</seg>
<seg id="41">And there is a park .</seg>
<seg id="42">One could say of course , I 'll watch competitions every day .</seg>
<seg id="43">But normally you head off at eight in the morning , and go until nine , or eleven in the evening .</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be gratifying to watch the others compete for two weeks once you have completed your competition , but unfortunately that is not the case with most athletes .</seg>
<seg id="45">For most of them , the pressure is taken off .</seg>
<seg id="46">Many of them are in a relationship .</seg>
<seg id="47">That is about thirty percent of them .</seg>
<seg id="48">The other seventy percent are usually not .</seg>
<seg id="49">There are different kinds of people there .</seg>
<seg id="50">More females , more males .</seg>
<seg id="51">Yes , and this is usually what happens .</seg>
<seg id="52">You gather at the Olympic village in the evenings .</seg>
<seg id="53">There are bushes there , one sort of tr tr or another , yes , bush-like trees , which make for wonderful hiding places .</seg>
<seg id="54">You have a small room with a bed inside , which in most cases , yes , is barely ninety centimetres wide and two metres long .</seg>
<seg id="55">It is just right for one person .</seg>
<seg id="56">For some , unfortunately , their feet will have to stick out , I have the basketball players in mind .</seg>
<seg id="57">Unfortunately , that 's how it is sometimes .</seg>
<seg id="58">But then you meet in the evenings .</seg>
<seg id="59">And then it doesn 't usually only involve meeting up and the beer that comes with that .</seg>
<seg id="60">Which is what athletes also like to do at times .</seg>
<seg id="61">So they drink a beer in the evenings after a competition .</seg>
<seg id="62">After four years of being deprived of sleep , family , friends , drink , parties , the whole pressure is now taken off and you have time again .</seg>
<seg id="63">And then someone walks over , because the person opposite has also had the pressure taken off them and doesn 't have to compete anymore , and then you go across the road .</seg>
<seg id="64">We have already heard it being told so beautifully .</seg>
<seg id="65">You catch someone 's attention because you have such an aura .</seg>
<seg id="66">You can see that .</seg>
<seg id="67">Hey , they have been liberated .</seg>
<seg id="68">They have clear thoughts .</seg>
<seg id="69">They are no longer focused .</seg>
<seg id="70">They know what they don 't have to do tomorrow .</seg>
<seg id="71">Namely , they don 't have to go to the swimming pool , they don 't have to swim a hundred metres anymore , but simply , for the next two weeks , at best , they can just enjoy themselves .</seg>
<seg id="72">Here we have one such victim .</seg>
<seg id="73">He has finished his competition after about six days .</seg>
<seg id="74">This is Ryan Lochte , an American swimmer .</seg>
<seg id="75">The second most successful swimmer in these Olympic Games .</seg>
<seg id="76">He also took part in the Olympic Games in Beijing in two thousand and eight .</seg>
<seg id="77">Back then , he was</seg>
<seg id="78">His mother said that it was a real shame .</seg>
<seg id="79">She witnessed the agony her son had gone through four years ago .</seg>
<seg id="80">As did his girlfriend at the time .</seg>
<seg id="81">This time , he arrived single .</seg>
<seg id="82">This made everything much more simple for him , of course , because</seg>
<seg id="83">That was the wrong way .</seg>
<seg id="84">There are many females who are willing to mate at the Olympic Games .</seg>
<seg id="85">Here we have a Russian synchronized swimming group from Russia , which is also very well-known for partying in the evenings with vodka and everything associated with that .</seg>
<seg id="86">And on most evenings they end up someplace .</seg>
<seg id="87">And usually in some bush , as in most cases , you don 't stay in the room alone .</seg>
<seg id="88">So mostly , the only option is somewhere outdoors .</seg>
<seg id="89">And then it happens .</seg>
<seg id="90">Here we also have some nice ladies at the opening ceremony .</seg>
<seg id="91">The Game volunteers and helpers are actually also excited by the atmosphere and are drawn in by it when they have successfully completed their tasks at the beginning of the day in the Olympic village and they also stay there , yes .</seg>
<seg id="92">And then of course , as an athlete , going back to Ryan Lochte , you are spoilt for choice .</seg>
<seg id="93">Who shall I pick now then ?</seg>
<seg id="94">And so it can 't also be excluded , that one may choose more than one in the evenings .</seg>
<seg id="95">And meanwhile , one has taken the whole some precautions .</seg>
<seg id="96">They have taken this into consideration .</seg>
<seg id="97">Since two thousand and four , condoms have been handed out .</seg>
<seg id="98">There is a so-called welcome package you are given when you arrive at the village .</seg>
<seg id="99">The mayor personally hands them out to the leaders of the delegations .</seg>
<seg id="100">There are usually three condoms in it .</seg>
<seg id="101">We have now made the calculations , three condoms , and there are sixteen days of competition .</seg>
<seg id="102">There is a massive discrepancy .</seg>
<seg id="103">That is not enough , yes .</seg>
<seg id="104">But they have though of that , too .</seg>
<seg id="105">The people who work at the Olympic Games are not that stupid .</seg>
<seg id="106">They know that the thirty five thousand condoms which they put in the welcome packages are not enough .</seg>
<seg id="107">They ordered another two hundred thousand on top of that .</seg>
<seg id="108">And these had also , we are sorry to say , run out after ten days of competition this year .</seg>
<seg id="109">Yes , so , one can see that the young men and ladies go completely wild .</seg>
<seg id="110">One really shouldn 't walk alone through this park after a certain time in the evenings .</seg>
<seg id="111">One should really be worried there , that they don 't</seg>
<seg id="112">Yes , if you are lucky , it 'll be fine , as one says , I can live with that .</seg>
<seg id="113">If you are unlucky , then you can 't .</seg>
<seg id="114">But this is a frequent occurrence , and it takes place more or less every evening .</seg>
<seg id="115">But then there is also , here for example , this family structure , because you are still part of a team , meaning , that you go back to your pack , because , as they say , it 's also good to feel as though you are part of a family .</seg>
<seg id="116">There are also community actions .</seg>
<seg id="117">And there like me today .</seg>
<seg id="118">I brought Michael with me .</seg>
<seg id="119">And now we move on to networking .</seg>
<seg id="120">Because Michael is German , and I am going to be French today</seg>
<seg id="121">Yes , and Micha thinks than Jochen is quite nice .</seg>
<seg id="122">Joche is Greek , and I have had a pleasant time with the Greeks this week , like Ryan Lochte .</seg>
<seg id="123">And then they both meet , and they both think the other is rather nice , likeable .</seg>
<seg id="124">And then it 's the same story again , because we need a condom again .</seg>
<seg id="125">Unfortunately , that 's what happens at the Olympic Games .</seg>
<seg id="126">And there are more highlights with every day that goes by ,</seg>
<seg id="127">that are then followed by endless fireworks</seg>
<seg id="128">And there you have it .</seg>
<seg id="129">That , on the other hand , is scaring me now .</seg>
<seg id="130">But now we have other examples here , that a little part Games .</seg>
<seg id="131">Here we have a British diver .</seg>
<seg id="132">He was the star of the British diving team , or of the British Olympic team in general , it is Tom Daley .</seg>
<seg id="133">A young man , seventeen years old , who also found his internal fire at the games , after having experienced some setbacks in recent years .</seg>
<seg id="134">And this fire could easily reignite within him , but also for his sport and life .</seg>
<seg id="135">But he was one of those who had to be highly concentrated for two weeks , because his first competition was on the first day and his last competition was on the penultimate day .</seg>
<seg id="136">He was unfortunate during these Games .</seg>
<seg id="137">Divers , it 's only fair to say , are very unlucky people during these Games , because they have to focus on the competition the whole time .</seg>
<seg id="138">But even he can 't save himself from some screaming teens who are standing in front of his hotel , standing in front of the Olympic village and standing in front of the stairs at the location of the competition to worship him .</seg>
<seg id="139">Because , it must be said , the British are a funny sort of people who worship everyone who is under eighteen , looks good , gets naked every now and then and performs .</seg>
<seg id="140">And he does that in such an irresistible manner .</seg>
<seg id="141">Last year , he became world champion in Shanghai and since then there has been a huge hype about him .</seg>
<seg id="142">Yes , and then of course you can see him shinning after his competition , in which he was in fourth place .</seg>
<seg id="143">And he is that kind of person , and you have to give him credit for that , and according to my knowledge , which is quite good , as his room was two rooms from mine , he received no female visitors during that time , and as far as his supervisor told me , he didn 't receive any female visitors outside his room either .</seg>
<seg id="144">So , he belonged to the category of those nice people , who didn 't consider his fireworks and the highlight of these games to be sexual , but instead he concentrated purely on sport during these Olympic Games .</seg>
<seg id="145">Which is also quite remarkable , and not everyone is like that .</seg>
<seg id="146">And then the Games come to a close with a huge firework and music show in London .</seg>
<seg id="147">And everyone , and I also think the supervisors and the athletes , are already looking forward to the Olympic village in Rio .</seg>
<seg id="148">We still don 't have any information about that</seg>
<seg id="149">Unfortunately , we still haven 't received any information about that .</seg>
<seg id="150">So , they have yet to announce how many they will order for two thousand and sixteen .</seg>
<seg id="151">But I think it will be a similar amount to the one in two thousand and twelve .</seg>

<seg id="1">Big data . Great life .</seg>
<seg id="2">There is this incredibly nice supermarket in the U S A , where there are no cashiers anymore .</seg>
<seg id="3">Nobody at the tills .</seg>
<seg id="4">And there was this great story about a woman who goes to the till and scans in all her stuff .</seg>
<seg id="5">And once she 's done , the till says to her , congratulations , you 're pregnant .</seg>
<seg id="6">A relatively difficult story .</seg>
<seg id="7">It 's true , apparently .</seg>
<seg id="8">And we 'll be looking not at till systems today , but , and I 'm from the entertainment industry , from the music industry , we 'll be looking at this subject big data , which we 're all a little scare of at the moment , because we 're thinking , oh our data , what 's happening there , we 're being pursued by Zalando shoes every day , will anything good ever come out of it .</seg>
<seg id="9">And let 's take a look .</seg>
<seg id="10">We don 't really need to be scared .</seg>
<seg id="11">Maybe some of you know the film I mean the Internet is not that old , I 'm older , seven thousand five hundred days older approximately .</seg>
<seg id="12">We 've learned quite a lot in contemporary history about what happens on an interpersonal level .</seg>
<seg id="13">We can see for example that when when that happens , we know the shoe will end up there .</seg>
<seg id="14">If it wouldn 't end up there , we 'd be on the Internet .</seg>
<seg id="15">And that 's why it 's a bit difficult , let me do it like this .</seg>
<seg id="16">That 's why it 's</seg>
<seg id="17">We 're scared , because what will happen with it and the data and all that .</seg>
<seg id="18">But now we 're people who say , okay the Internet might save TV .</seg>
<seg id="19">I 'll tell you why .</seg>
<seg id="20">What needs to be saved here anyway ?</seg>
<seg id="21">And how can the Internet do that ?</seg>
<seg id="22">By the way , I 'm always half full .</seg>
<seg id="23">And I don 't mean drinking by that , but that 's why I 'm so calm , very calm , all these people here .</seg>
<seg id="24">Right , the gla</seg>
<seg id="25">Things didn 't always used to be better .</seg>
<seg id="26">That 's bullshit .</seg>
<seg id="27">Yeah , things were better in the past , I worked in advertising , we used to have big budgets .</seg>
<seg id="28">Then I got into the music industry , oh we used to really make a lot of money .</seg>
<seg id="29">Rubbish .</seg>
<seg id="30">Everything could be a lot nicer , we just need to think differently .</seg>
<seg id="31">And that 's why I say I 'm always pressing the wrong button here .</seg>
<seg id="32">Tomorrow everything will be better hahaha .</seg>
<seg id="33">So the way it could be is So the Internet will</seg>
<seg id="34">I 'll make a comparison , so how should the Internet save TV .</seg>
<seg id="35">And that 's what I 'll be talking about today .</seg>
<seg id="36">So I 'll look at the entertainment part in this subject big data .</seg>
<seg id="37">And from the entertainment part I 'll take the TV part and say okay , how can it be</seg>
<seg id="38">The plague and cholera , TV and Internet .</seg>
<seg id="39">That 's the situation .</seg>
<seg id="40">Why is TV like the plague today ?</seg>
<seg id="41">Ninety eight percent of Germans say their favourite pastime of all is not drinking , not having sex , no , it 's watching TV .</seg>
<seg id="42">But I think , and perhaps I 'm mega-intellectual , I 've been sitting in front of this bloody box for ten years and it no longer interests me .</seg>
<seg id="43">The first screen in a space has degenerated into a second and third screen .</seg>
<seg id="44">I only turn the TV on to tune out .</seg>
<seg id="45">I turn it on , and , how nice , I can fall asleep , isn 't that great .</seg>
<seg id="46">Here ten forty five p.m. Arte my ass .</seg>
<seg id="47">I have to comply to that bloody box ?</seg>
<seg id="48">How ridiculous is that ?</seg>
<seg id="49">And I could go on like this for another half an hour .</seg>
<seg id="50">In the past you 'd have Colt Seavers , everybody would be sitting together in one room .</seg>
<seg id="51">It worked .</seg>
<seg id="52">Today I mean it doesn 't interest anyone anymore .</seg>
<seg id="53">Was Dallas simply better than the series today ?</seg>
<seg id="54">I don 't think so , when I look at it now .</seg>
<seg id="55">I once studied Directing , that was in , oh well , who cares .</seg>
<seg id="56">It no longer works .</seg>
<seg id="57">And it 's not their fault .</seg>
<seg id="58">It 's our fault .</seg>
<seg id="59">We enjoy being couch potatoes .</seg>
<seg id="60">I really love watching the box .</seg>
<seg id="61">But it no longer works .</seg>
<seg id="62">And if we now say , the glass is half full , let 's just take that , then what works ?</seg>
<seg id="63">So let 's no longer grumble about , let 's say , what does work in TV ?</seg>
<seg id="64">The simplicity .</seg>
<seg id="65">It 's nice and simple .</seg>
<seg id="66">Let 's take , I mean we want the Internet to save TV , let 's take the simplicity and put it aside and say , okay , we have that for starters .</seg>
<seg id="67">The second is the Internet , which we already mentioned , it 's like cholera .</seg>
<seg id="68">Why do I think the Internet would be like cholera ?</seg>
<seg id="69">It might help me become very rich at the moment .</seg>
<seg id="70">I 'm totally swamped .</seg>
<seg id="71">With all that 's happening on the Internet .</seg>
<seg id="72">And with what the Internet does with me .</seg>
<seg id="73">And this amount of data , that rains down on me , is swamping me .</seg>
<seg id="74">And that 's not only the case with the Internet , it 's like this everywhere .</seg>
<seg id="75">Ten years ago I could still go into a café and say I 'd like a cup of coffee , please .</seg>
<seg id="76">And then I 'd be told , you can have a pot of coffee outside or a cup of coffee and you can sit down , done .</seg>
<seg id="77">Pure coffee . Fantastic .</seg>
<seg id="78">Today the following happens . I go into a coffee shop , double shot mocha cookie crumble frappuccino fat free soy frozen vanilla .</seg>
<seg id="79">And I 'm not told , excuse me , are you alright ?</seg>
<seg id="80">No , I get the answer , to go ?</seg>
<seg id="81">Okay .</seg>
<seg id="82">What the fuck ? What ha ha</seg>
<seg id="83">What happened there ?</seg>
<seg id="84">Are we stupid or is Starbucks stupid ?</seg>
<seg id="85">Individualisation , globalisation , digitalisation , individualisation .</seg>
<seg id="86">Each one of us is different today .</seg>
<seg id="87">And yet somehow the same .</seg>
<seg id="88">It certainly used to be every easy to make a music programme in the past .</seg>
<seg id="89">We had two bands , the Stones and the Beatles , and that was it .</seg>
<seg id="90">Eighty percent of people , highly individualised and so we 're slowly crawling towards what I want to get to .</seg>
<seg id="91">Individualisation , because that 's the situation today .</seg>
<seg id="92">We have forty five thousand music videos , and a mega number of bands .</seg>
<seg id="93">And it 's all interesting somehow .</seg>
<seg id="94">And they all want to be interesting .</seg>
<seg id="95">And so we thought we 'd do the following .</seg>
<seg id="96">With all this flood of data , we 'll just do multitasking .</seg>
<seg id="97">That will solve the problem really .</seg>
<seg id="98">So not us men , but certainly the women .</seg>
<seg id="99">They can do that .</seg>
<seg id="100">Yeah ? Bullshit .</seg>
<seg id="101">A study was conducted that showed that when you actively engage in multitasking , your I Q is lowered by ten percent .</seg>
<seg id="102">At that moment .</seg>
<seg id="103">I know many women where that doesn 't matter because then they still have one hundred and thirty .</seg>
<seg id="104">But with me it would probably be eighty .</seg>
<seg id="105">And I can 't run a business with that anymore then .</seg>
<seg id="106">So this , oh right And it has the same effect as smoking a big fat spliff .</seg>
<seg id="107">So do multitasking more often .</seg>
<seg id="108">Rubbish .</seg>
<seg id="109">So the second solution on the Internet with all that data , so a data diet would be good .</seg>
<seg id="110">Yes , we 'll do the following now .</seg>
<seg id="111">Read our emails on Monday , delete then all on Tuesday , read them again on Wednesday .</seg>
<seg id="112">That doesn 't work either , I tried it .</seg>
<seg id="113">Quite a few people turn up and say , what 's going on with my email .</seg>
<seg id="114">But there is some sense to the word diet .</seg>
<seg id="115">There 's a bad sense , we know that because that 's what women 's magazines live off .</seg>
<seg id="116">And there 's a good sense , the sense of reduction .</seg>
<seg id="117">And that 's where we hit the core , before we go totally mad here .</seg>
<seg id="118">I also heard that the presentation must include the words diet and burnout .</seg>
<seg id="119">Those are the words that are most used .</seg>
<seg id="120">I thought it was good , because it 's really true .</seg>
<seg id="121">With all these apps and that , I I 'm really forced into this digital native role .</seg>
<seg id="122">At some point we 'll go mad .</seg>
<seg id="123">And we need some kind of diet here .</seg>
<seg id="124">And a diet could be its curation .</seg>
<seg id="125">And to take it a step further , I 'm not really interested in such a large-scale curation .</seg>
<seg id="126">if we take the simplicity of TV and the intelligence of the Internet , yes .</seg>
<seg id="127">And then we do the following .</seg>
<seg id="128">We basically connect the two .</seg>
<seg id="129">Then a personal curation gives us the incredible chance to take TV out of this boredom and create something that really interests us .</seg>
<seg id="130">By simply turning things around and saying , why doesn 't my customer find me .</seg>
<seg id="131">Why do I have to , just because Youtube was clever to activate that possibility , have to know everything .</seg>
<seg id="132">I know entertainment works like that , sit down , turn on the TV , stare .</seg>
<seg id="133">But the problem is , nothing more was being shown that interested me .</seg>
<seg id="134">And not only did it not interest me , it didn 't interest anybody else .</seg>
<seg id="135">Or they have to comply with it .</seg>
<seg id="136">Because how would it be if you sit down and something , regardless of the device you 're watching it on , regardless of whom you 're watching it with , always comes that interests you .</seg>
<seg id="137">And even if you just want to tune out .</seg>
<seg id="138">Or you want to educate yourself , or see something interesting .</seg>
<seg id="139">And it 's not about the right content , it 's about this feeling .</seg>
<seg id="140">The woman is the user and the bear is the content .</seg>
<seg id="141">This warm feeling .</seg>
<seg id="142">I don 't know how you feel about it .</seg>
<seg id="143">It Millions of Germans went to see that film where that boat sank .</seg>
<seg id="144">Everybody knew what was going to happen .</seg>
<seg id="145">It sank , they all died . And yet they watched it .</seg>
<seg id="146">Because entertainment works .</seg>
<seg id="147">You know more or less what you 're getting yourself into .</seg>
<seg id="148">And then you want to be surprised .</seg>
<seg id="149">But then you 're sitting in the cinema and thinking , oh cool , cool sound , everything 's great .</seg>
<seg id="150">I love watching .</seg>
<seg id="151">And then it works again .</seg>
<seg id="152">We must consider that we now have three Internets , the plural in German is a little difficult .</seg>
<seg id="153">It links up our previous usage of the Internet .</seg>
<seg id="154">So the Internet is not only changing the world , it 's changing the nature of looking .</seg>
<seg id="155">That means , on demand , so sometimes you already know , you go to Ted dot com , watch the presentation , do a search .</seg>
<seg id="156">But honestly , excuse me for asking , can that website recommend me something I 'm interested in ?</seg>
<seg id="157">I mean , can 't it somehow It knows me .</seg>
<seg id="158">In terms of big data I 've been giving everything to this Internet for the past five years .</seg>
<seg id="159">Can 't someone , I turn it on and three presentations appear , they 're curated for me .</seg>
<seg id="160">And that 's why we connect searching , communication , social curation .</seg>
<seg id="161">So no longer one million people found it funny that the cat falls from the tree but ten of my friends think it 's funny and recommend it .</seg>
<seg id="162">And now the third thing is coming , and many didn 't hear the starting shot , now the entertainment net is coming .</seg>
<seg id="163">The big networks are slowly noticing .</seg>
<seg id="164">And Netflix are coming to Europe , Vivendi is starting up .</seg>
<seg id="165">Entertainment is coming to the Internet in data speeds that weren 't possible until now .</seg>
<seg id="166">I just heard it , Jojo byte .</seg>
<seg id="167">Sounds a bit like diet .</seg>
<seg id="168">If we connect these things together , we have the chance of finally making something appear on this bloody box that interest us .</seg>
<seg id="169">And that works in the following way , we curate the social footprint , so the social world and smart-ass editors for all likes .</seg>
<seg id="170">Man-machine systems .</seg>
<seg id="171">A cash register system , if a cashier had sat there and seen that it was a man who went shopping for his girlfriend , she wouldn 't have said congratulations , you 're pregnant .</seg>
<seg id="172">And generally the concept that you find out you 're pregnant in a supermarket would have to be reassessed .</seg>
<seg id="173">But the idea is that the work is done behind the screen and not in front of it .</seg>
<seg id="174">I just want to be entertained .</seg>
<seg id="175">Sometimes you know what you want .</seg>
<seg id="176">But we 'll deliver the soundtrack for this moment .</seg>
<seg id="177">And that 's the future .</seg>
<seg id="178">She didn 't even know she wanted a Berliner , even though she was in Berlin .</seg>
<seg id="179">It was just in her .</seg>
<seg id="180">That brings us back to power and the great presentation .</seg>
<seg id="181">That 's what it 's about .</seg>
<seg id="182">You don 't need to always know everything , you just have to feel it .</seg>
<seg id="183">And then we 'll deliver it .</seg>
<seg id="184">That that 's a bit scary , okay big data .</seg>
<seg id="185">But let 's just grab the chance and we 'll have to take care of all the other stuff with data security and all that , but we have the chance to make things better .</seg>
<seg id="186">Then on and always awesome .</seg>
<seg id="187">That 's the actual idea .</seg>
<seg id="188">And then the job will have been done .</seg>

<doc docid="E08_TEDxBerlin-Thinking-Change-Gesi" genre="lectures">
<talkid>E08_TEDxBerlin-Thinking-Change-Gesi</talkid>
<seg id="1">﻿ Thank you very much for this friendly invitation to speak .</seg>
<seg id="2">And of course my heart is beating , because I ’ m wondering whether I can do this within just eighteen minutes , but we ’ ll see .</seg>
<seg id="3">I can ’ t provide a technological innovation , rather it 's all about change , thinking about change , putting forth the idea that we need a fresh start , one that we can also complete , a practical one , in collaboration with one another .</seg>
<seg id="4">When I was twelve years old , I went for a longer period to France , for the first time , together with my older brother , it ’ s good to have a big brother , with whom you can do that , to stay in a French family for six weeks .</seg>
<seg id="5">We were meant to learn decent French there .</seg>
<seg id="6">Our parents wanted that .</seg>
<seg id="7">We arrived in a small village near Besançon , Saint-Vit , an old house in the village , walked through the courtyard , and came into the kitchen .</seg>
<seg id="8">It was evening .</seg>
<seg id="9">A large , long table was set up there , and the parents were sitting at this table , the Italian grandmother , five of their own children , four pensionnaires , who were housed in the holidays there , and finally my brother and I were added to the mix , eleven kids in all , three adults .</seg>
<seg id="10">We all sat at the dinner table and I remember very well , I was pretty tired from the trip , and I wondered if I would ever understand what was going on around me .</seg>
<seg id="11">I didn ’ t understand a word .</seg>
<seg id="12">It was horrible .</seg>
<seg id="13">I was there for six weeks , and then I got it .</seg>
<seg id="14">It was a great joy to learn in this context , with this many children , this language , of which I was already familiar with a bit .</seg>
<seg id="15">And I have to say , I also learned the joy of Europe , it was implanted very early in me .</seg>
<seg id="16">About twelve years later , I drove through Poland to prepare my dissertation .</seg>
<seg id="17">I took the train through Silesia and the air was totally grey , and full of sand .</seg>
<seg id="18">It was actually very depressing .</seg>
<seg id="19">A beautiful day , but very grey .</seg>
<seg id="20">And I thought very wistfully , how nice it would be if this Europe could be one and we could take care of these things together , to have clean air , to be excited about the landscape and what is possible there .</seg>
<seg id="21">And one year later , the occupation of Prague occurred .</seg>
<seg id="22">And again , I thought , as did my friends , how beautiful Europe could be if it were not for these terrible boundaries and systemic contrasts , how diverse , all of a sudden travelling from Vienna to Budapest to Prague and back to Paris , how wonderful .</seg>
<seg id="23">And a lot took place in Europe .</seg>
<seg id="24">We took more and more pleasure in that , at least in Western Europe .</seg>
<seg id="25">Of course , the effort level was quite high , but there was enthusiasm , parts of which I can clearly remember .</seg>
<seg id="26">There was a big singing festival in Aix-en-Provence .</seg>
<seg id="27">It was called the Jeunesse Musicales .</seg>
<seg id="28">The choirs were internationally mixed , and at some point we visited the old amphithéâtre in Vaison-la-Romaine , we sat around there , I can no longer say exactly how many , but we were probably at least three hundred , four hundred people in several choirs , and we began to sing various things .</seg>
<seg id="29">It was such a wonderful feeling , it was such a joyful feeling .</seg>
<seg id="30">This all represents Europe for me .</seg>
<seg id="31">Yes , and Europe coalesced more and more , it came together , the Europe of various nations , it went through crises , sure .</seg>
<seg id="32">Crisis became the norm .</seg>
<seg id="33">But it continued , in part because there were politicians , who were really attached to Europe , who really wanted to achieve something with Europe , who wanted it to advance .</seg>
<seg id="34">In Nineteen Eighty-Nine , the iron curtain opened up , and it continued .</seg>
<seg id="35">Now I ’ ll pause for a bit and say , that now we ’ re involved in the biggest crisis ever .</seg>
<seg id="36">It ’ s a major crisis that can be so dramatic that we do not always remind ourselves of that .</seg>
<seg id="37">And I think it is because these different nation-states that have come together always legitimate themselves in their national contexts , and the politicians think they have to tell them what they want to hear , those who have elected them , that is , and they need to act as if they were only concerned with national benefits .</seg>
<seg id="38">This is a great misfortune in the structure of Europe .</seg>
<seg id="39">And we can see in this moment that this misfortune is becoming more tangible .</seg>
<seg id="40">It is the same problem everywhere , this national legitimacy .</seg>
<seg id="41">But Germany currently has a special responsibility .</seg>
<seg id="42">And in Germany , in the current Germany , the illusion has been fostered that we could move forward on an island of privilege , without having to take care of the others and without thinking about whether we are acting in solidarity with them or not .</seg>
<seg id="43">A turning point must be set here so that we can make a fresh star t .</seg>
<seg id="44">This will not be possible , given the old structure .</seg>
<seg id="45">I can see that now already .</seg>
<seg id="46">Instead , a new structure will be required .</seg>
<seg id="47">And this new structure will correspond to the fact that we do not live in national conflict , but that we have other problems .</seg>
<seg id="48">That these problems have to be solved across national borders .</seg>
<seg id="49">That is , the remedy of the present crisis , which is first and foremost an economic crisis , which is a national one that has also become a cultural one , must come from society .</seg>
<seg id="50">For the governments legitimized by national elections are obviously not capable of progressing without help from society .</seg>
<seg id="51">They cannot be abolished .</seg>
<seg id="52">I know of no alternative to this political system .</seg>
<seg id="53">But the way they run now , governments are increasingly running against one another and not with one another .</seg>
<seg id="54">And Germany takes on a special responsibility here , because we are still in an exceptionally strong economic situation , though we do not want to help and though nationally , at the national government level , we do not want to help .</seg>
<seg id="55">I say this very dramatically .</seg>
<seg id="56">When the crisis started , we said that met the legal conditions of Maastricht , each nation must always help itself out of its own mess .</seg>
<seg id="57">No bailing out .</seg>
<seg id="58">But this is exactly what will not work .</seg>
<seg id="59">Only when we realize , here in Germany , that the current crisis must be mastered together , only then will it work .</seg>
<seg id="60">My impression is that we are having such a difficult time because we are actually so well off .</seg>
<seg id="61">One of the most prominent political scientists , who taught many years ago at Otto-Suhr-Institute , a Bohemian Czech Jew , who was forced to flee to America , and became a Harvard political scientist , once said at the middle of the last century , that power is the ability not to have to learn .</seg>
<seg id="62">I sometimes say it even more dramatically .</seg>
<seg id="63">Power is the ability to remain stupid .</seg>
<seg id="64">Germany and the German government currently have the impression , apparently , that it still has power and does not have to learn .</seg>
<seg id="65">But it needs to learn from those who do not have so much power , to learn that we need to stand together , that we need to stick together to overcome problems .</seg>
<seg id="66">It ’ s the same as at the national level , when the financial problem started , two people from the government said that we guarantee you can withdraw your money from the banks .</seg>
<seg id="67">There was , to be honest , no substantial justification for that .</seg>
<seg id="68">It was pure bluff .</seg>
<seg id="69">But it was an effective and necessary bluff .</seg>
<seg id="70">This was the only way to take the steam out of the situation .</seg>
<seg id="71">This is just what we need to do at the European level .</seg>
<seg id="72">And it must come from society , because national governments won ’ t do it alone .</seg>
<seg id="73">I observe everywhere , in all responsible parties which have to submit to elections , that they can see exactly what the situation is , but that they don ’ t want to say it , because they fear , they all know that we are in a union of shared liability , a transfer union , which is clear to everyone , but they are afraid that if they say it , they will be punished at the next election .</seg>
<seg id="74">I think , by the way , they underestimate society .</seg>
<seg id="75">I believe that people are much too smart to perceive what ’ s going on , and are not so narrow-minded , and are very generous , the people are this way , if you make it clear what it ’ s all about and what opportunities they have .</seg>
<seg id="76">And that ’ s what matters now , that we are organizing this from society outwards .</seg>
<seg id="77">This is what I mean with the idea of good governance , in other words , the integration of Europe using good governance .</seg>
<seg id="78">This means that we need to supplement our current governance , that is , our system of government , with Parliament and the executive , i.e. the government , and all of the judiciary , and so on .</seg>
<seg id="79">From within society , we need to find basic consensus about how we will proceed , beyond legislative periods , beyond party competition and regardless of what individuals strive for after the election .</seg>
<seg id="80">This is now the task and I also believe that we can accomplish this .</seg>
<seg id="81">We have , namely , a number of possible projects , and collaborative projects allow people to connect the best with one another .</seg>
<seg id="82">We see this in smaller contexts as well as in larger contexts .</seg>
<seg id="83">Germany has announced an energy revolution .</seg>
<seg id="84">This is a huge project .</seg>
<seg id="85">It ’ s not easy to do this .</seg>
<seg id="86">But it is quite impossible without the help of Europe .</seg>
<seg id="87">And it is actually also impossible to do it without the world .</seg>
<seg id="88">We have a wonderful opportunity , because many are looking at us , who were first saying , well , they ’ re actually a bit mad regarding this idea , but who then say , well , they might be on to something .</seg>
<seg id="89">These energy sources , the sun and wind , are perhaps a little pricey now , but if we continue the process , then it will probably not be more expensive , then , on the contrary , it will be much cheaper .</seg>
<seg id="90">That ’ s what those who are calculating the costs are saying , at any rate .</seg>
<seg id="91">But what matters now is that we agree about the various stakeholders , about the various groups , beyond the various individual interests .</seg>
<seg id="92">This does not happen enough .</seg>
<seg id="93">Among other things , because where this should actually take place in our political system , is namely in Parliament , and it is no longer debating the matter .</seg>
<seg id="94">We have just had the great fortune that the Federal Constitutional Court has said that this cannot go on .</seg>
<seg id="95">Parliament must be involved .</seg>
<seg id="96">Because Parliament is the place where one can discuss different positions .</seg>
<seg id="97">And that has a profound importance .</seg>
<seg id="98">It ’ s not about a fight , it ’ s not about a row , it ’ s not about all that .</seg>
<seg id="99">Rather , it is important that the debate , this argumentative discussion , offers us the chance to come together and find the best possible solution .</seg>
<seg id="100">If we suppress this , if we suppress public debate about the way we want to go , we will end up with worse solutions .</seg>
<seg id="101">We know this from experience .</seg>
<seg id="102">This will cost us a bit of effort and the change , the transformation that is needed is not one that we can simply introduce technologically , in a quick manner , but rather one that has to occur involving all of us .</seg>
<seg id="103">So , this energy revolution is both a shift to another source for power , transport and heat , but it 's actually a turn towards a new form of energy from society .</seg>
<seg id="104">Because energy is something , and we have seen this in the past , that affects us all .</seg>
<seg id="105">With the energy revolution , we need to adopt a new form of energy , and join together with others across borders , in Europe and also beyond , of course , in order to think about how we can all , with technological means , but also with understanding , with generosity , with assistance , come to the point that we can manage this collective project effectively .</seg>
<seg id="106">For my part , I have always had dealings with Poland .</seg>
<seg id="107">For Poland in particular , it is currently very difficult to undertake this energy transition , for specific economic reasons .</seg>
<seg id="108">We should not return to old prejudices again , as is currently very much in vogue , and which I find almost unbearable , but we have to look at what the interests are , where the bottlenecks are that need to be overcome , and how we can be of assistance .</seg>
<seg id="109">But it also works with other neighbours , France is advising us , because the French have always had a very different tradition in terms of energy policy .</seg>
<seg id="110">Promoting this shared project and showing that the energy revolution is not only a purely isolated German thing , but that we can drive it forward , together with others , represents a huge opportunity .</seg>
<seg id="111">The same applies to all the other challenges that we face , saving resources , climate protection , but also social security .</seg>
<seg id="112">These are all important points .</seg>
<seg id="113">We can ’ t try to build a continent with fifty per cent youth unemployment in Spain , Italy and Greece .</seg>
<seg id="114">This is completely beyond question .</seg>
<seg id="115">These are all challenges .</seg>
<seg id="116">The other day someone asked me if it wasn ’ t true that previously Europe had been an advantage , but today it brings us so much effort , and therefore is no longer as popular .</seg>
<seg id="117">I would say that just the opposite is true .</seg>
<seg id="118">We can only enjoy , or find exciting , something that really requires an effort from us .</seg>
<seg id="119">I imagine the land of milk and honey as being pretty bleak , pretty boring .</seg>
<seg id="120">What am I supposed to do there ?</seg>
<seg id="121">So , bringing about effort and jointly overcoming difficulties with effort is what brings us together .</seg>
<seg id="122">Also the debate about the correct path .</seg>
<seg id="123">That ’ s why I advocate that we make a change , not only in terms of energy , in the energy revolution , but a change in political culture , a change in the political system , as a supplementary measure .</seg>
<seg id="124">So that we can join together and say , stop all the talk about some old-age provision that seems so unfair .</seg>
<seg id="125">If you look closely , it is much more complicated .</seg>
<seg id="126">People are not facing off against one another .</seg>
<seg id="127">There are interest groups facing off against one another .</seg>
<seg id="128">And tax evasion also occurs Germany , not just in Greece , at the moment to an extent which is not good , but that is not reserved for the Greeks .</seg>
<seg id="129">It occurs in our country , too .</seg>
<seg id="130">So , remembering that is very important to me .</seg>
<seg id="131">We should recall the great virtues or maxims of Immanuel Kant , for what he called public spirit .</seg>
<seg id="132">These are three maxims that are so nice and short that even I can remember them .</seg>
<seg id="133">The first maxim is to think for oneself .</seg>
<seg id="134">The second maxim is to always think concordantly with your beliefs .</seg>
<seg id="135">That means not behaving in such a manner that you say to yourself , why should I care what I said yesterday , but instead remembering what I said yesterday , and I don ’ t always have to say and think the same thing , but if I change , I must be able to clarify that and I need to be able to explain it , or else I will be completely unreliable for others and they can ’ t understand what I 'm doing .</seg>
<seg id="136">Reliability and trust are the most important cement in a society .</seg>
<seg id="137">And the third maxim is to think in the mind-set of others .</seg>
<seg id="138">To put yourself in the place of another , this is the maxim of justice .</seg>
<seg id="139">This idea has suffered over the past three or four years in Europe , and has also been stepped upon by political celebrities in a certain sense , so much that I have often felt ashamed .</seg>
<seg id="140">Only if you take the three maxims really seriously , including the maxim of justice , will we advance .</seg>
<seg id="141">If we put ourselves in the shoes of Ireland , Spain , Italy , Greece , but also of Poland , then we will get further and it can even be fun .</seg>
<seg id="142">It ’ s a true source of pleasure .</seg>
<seg id="143">For if we ask ourselves what really brings pleasure , happiness never comes about when you simply get everything you want .</seg>
<seg id="144">Happiness comes when I receive something from someone else , from a truly free , unselfish solidarity .</seg>
<seg id="145">Or if I give someone something , from a truly free , disinterested solidarity , that is to say , a solidarity that does not emerge from self-interest .</seg>
<seg id="146">This does not mean that we do not have to calculate when it comes to politics .</seg>
<seg id="147">Naturally , we have to do this .</seg>
<seg id="148">I ’ m not utopian , I ’ m too old for that .</seg>
<seg id="149">But to bring in a little bit of this other quality is something that is very , very , very important .</seg>
<seg id="150">And this is what I advocate .</seg>
<seg id="151">And I tell myself , that if we can do that , to join together through various political challenges , then we can transform this old definition of power that Karl Deutsch wrote about , so to speak , not because he found it positive , but simply because he observed it , namely , that power means not having to learn , so power , to put it tangibly , is the option of remaining stupid , and we can turn this into a new motto , that power is the ability to jointly move forward .</seg>
<seg id="152">That is Hannah Arendt ’ s definition of power .</seg>
<seg id="153">And although she was never a feminist , in fact , she resisted being called so , it is perhaps no coincidence that it is a female definition of power .</seg>
<seg id="154">Jointly moving forward .</seg>
<seg id="155">Joining together .</seg>
<seg id="156">And not only working against the others .</seg>
<seg id="157">That ’ s what matters .</seg>
<seg id="158">And I would advocate for this form of change , for an energy revolution from within .</seg>

<seg id="1">﻿ The future of energy .</seg>
<seg id="2">Energy of the future .</seg>
<seg id="3">And taking a look back into the past .</seg>
<seg id="4">Some facts about me .</seg>
<seg id="5">I was born in Berlin , my father is Iraqi , my mother is German , and I grew up in Damascus , Syria .</seg>
<seg id="6">Thank you .</seg>
<seg id="7">And I basically started to become interested in renewable energy , which we now call sustainable energy , in nineteen seventy-three .</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of you will still remember the so-called oil crisis in seventy-three .</seg>
<seg id="9">Driving was forbidden on Sundays here in November .</seg>
<seg id="10">And yes , suddenly everyone was talking about energy .</seg>
<seg id="11">I would go to university in the mornings and be greeted by , hey Achmed , what kind of bullshit are your sheiks up to ?</seg>
<seg id="12">Like that .</seg>
<seg id="13">And then of course , I started wondering what was true about that , right ?</seg>
<seg id="14">Is it really all bullshit or just politics or what ?</seg>
<seg id="15">And I started , as I 've already mentioned , to work with solar wind and all that stuff .</seg>
<seg id="16">People started hearing about the first developments .</seg>
<seg id="17">At university there was the IPAT , the Interdisciplinary Project group for Appropriate Technology , which was already experimenting with some equipment .</seg>
<seg id="18">And so on , and so on .</seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of the seventies I took over my well in seventy-seven I took over my parent 's engineering company .</seg>
<seg id="20">And within two years , the entire scope of projects , previously we had been working with government contracts , large industrial plants and so on , yes which we redirected , deflected towards things that can be done locally on the site .</seg>
<seg id="21">As a first step , namely the use of solar energy for hot water .</seg>
<seg id="22">So simple , small thermal installations .</seg>
<seg id="23">The biggest problem I faced at the time was that the sun is an enemy .</seg>
<seg id="24">People in North Africa , in many , every Arabic country and in many other countries also think that .</seg>
<seg id="25">Why ?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes , up until that point protecting themselves from it had been a priority .</seg>
<seg id="27">it wasn 't seen as an considered to be a positive energy source .</seg>
<seg id="28">one of the first collectors that we had ever built .</seg>
<seg id="29">Still relatively conventional technology , copper tubes , aluminium , but high-quality .</seg>
<seg id="30">Well , this installation is still on our roof after more than thirty years .</seg>
<seg id="31">It is still working .</seg>
<seg id="32">I hope the same goes for my customers .</seg>
<seg id="33">And then I was working in Syria until two months before the fall of the Berlin Wall .</seg>
<seg id="34">We also conducted experiments in the field of wind energy .</seg>
<seg id="35">This is a European patent , but this goes back to a young Iraqi engineer .</seg>
<seg id="36">And you can see that it is a simple metal sheet , cut out from the surface .</seg>
<seg id="37">But it is attached to two different blade roots .</seg>
<seg id="38">And if you look at the way I am standing here now , I am not standing on one foot like a stork .</seg>
<seg id="39">Because that is damn unstable or instable .</seg>
<seg id="40">Funnily enough , every rotor blade on the planet , in wind energy , turbine blades , , in ventilation , ship propellers , aircraft propellers , all have only one blade root .</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that all forces are concentrated at one point .</seg>
<seg id="42">In this regard , the technology is much more stable , simple , cheap and it also has an efficiency factor of thirty percent and more compared to unslotted blades .</seg>
<seg id="43">I failed miserably with this here , because the experts in Germany , to whom I wanted to present this system , said , Mr Khammas , if this were a great idea , then the our engineers would have discovered it long ago .</seg>
<seg id="44">It is a lost case .</seg>
<seg id="45">Then I moved on and wondered whether there were any other options .</seg>
<seg id="46">And I started to collect and structure all of the information I could get on renewable energy .</seg>
<seg id="47">And ultimately , it all starts with physical strength .</seg>
<seg id="48">Physical strength is a type of energy that is available to all of us immediately and at any time , as long as we are alive .</seg>
<seg id="49">And one shouldn 't underestimate what this , on average a quarter horsepower is calculated , what we can generate over a longer period of time predominantly , so now with a pedal over what do you call it , thigh muscles , one shouldn 't underestimate this , if you combine it with intelligence , you can get really far .</seg>
<seg id="50">Yes , intelligence is important .</seg>
<seg id="51">These are , for example , people from Australia , if I remember correctly , who were originally active in the field of wind energy , and they made it possible in many , many areas in Africa where there is a great demand for drinking water to at least get a tank which is also quite high , so that a conduit could be made .</seg>
<seg id="52">You turn on the tap and there is pressure , something we are all used to here .</seg>
<seg id="53">But how do I get the water to come up ?</seg>
<seg id="54">Well , with child labour .</seg>
<seg id="55">We all had such merry-go-rounds in our playgrounds , those things that rotate .</seg>
<seg id="56">When the children race around , an unbelievable amount of energy is produced .</seg>
<seg id="57">The entire time , as long as they don 't have any homework or something else to do , they run around , rotate that thing and simultaneously , the water is pumped up from the ground into the tank .</seg>
<seg id="58">The children are happy and the parents let them play because everyone has something to gain .</seg>
<seg id="59">I think this is a good concept .</seg>
<seg id="60">The Aquaskipper is as least as intelligent .</seg>
<seg id="61">In this part there are some short clips , I 'll show you where you can find them all later , where you can see a young man passing by a coxed four in an Aquaskipper , just using the movement of his thighs .</seg>
<seg id="62">Basically like the trot of a horse , you always have to create some resistance too .</seg>
<seg id="63">A bit more energy here</seg>
<seg id="64">There is nothing , no engine , no energy , just muscle power .</seg>
<seg id="65">You can see this is in the water , yes exactly down here , that is the bearing surface so to speak .</seg>
<seg id="66">The only part that 's flexible in the entire thing , it only goes to and fro a bit , and is basically imitating the tail fin of a dolphin , the movement generated by this pressure , you scuttle over the water .</seg>
<seg id="67">And anyone who 's really good at it can be wearing a dinner suit and jump onto it from the runway , go to the other end of the lake , jump back onto the other runway and not a get a single drop of water on the suit .</seg>
<seg id="68">You would need to have done some training , but it works .</seg>
<seg id="69">So it 's a brilliant concept on the idea of muscle power .</seg>
<seg id="70">Solar energy , which we 've mentioned several times here today , is a thing of the present .</seg>
<seg id="71">In the field of renewable energy it always comes first .</seg>
<seg id="72">The sun is big , after all , we all worshipped it at some point , whether it was in Egypt as Ra or perhaps here in Europe too .</seg>
<seg id="73">That 's a drawing of the famous story of Archimedes at the time , who used reflected sunlight to set the attacking fleet on fire .</seg>
<seg id="74">Whether that 's true or not is unknown .</seg>
<seg id="75">But there were several university groups that basically sim ulated the experiment and they were indeed able to set small boats on fire .</seg>
<seg id="76">So it works , theoretically .</seg>
<seg id="77">That was over two thousand years ago .</seg>
<seg id="78">This is a bit more recent , a few hundred years , Leonardo da Vinci .</seg>
<seg id="79">It appears to be a solar collector .</seg>
<seg id="80">Today we make big things , whether it 's Desertec , huge trough power plants or the photovoltaic panels that are here in Brandenburg .</seg>
<seg id="81">Those are dishes , parabolic reflectors .</seg>
<seg id="82">And in this thing up here you 'll often find a Stirling , a hot air engine .</seg>
<seg id="83">You can also come up with other technologies .</seg>
<seg id="84">Heat is concentrated .</seg>
<seg id="85">This concentrated heat can cause things to steam .</seg>
<seg id="86">I have steam , I can , in turn , convert steam into electricity or something inside turbines .</seg>
<seg id="87">But in two thousand and ten the United Nations defined this year , two thousand and twelve , as the International Year of Sustainable Energy for All within the framework of a resolution on</seg>
<seg id="88">And I 'd like to now underline this word for everybody .</seg>
<seg id="89">Things like this are not for everyone .</seg>
<seg id="90">It 's for a very small group of people , us basically , in the developed countries .</seg>
<seg id="91">This is much more important .</seg>
<seg id="92">Because exactly the same principle , absolutely , there is no difference physically , it 's just smaller , easier to make , I can imagine hundreds of thousands of garages everywhere in South America , in Africa , in Asia , making these little cookers .</seg>
<seg id="93">It 's already happening .</seg>
<seg id="94">There are a lot of initiatives , but it 's still far too little .</seg>
<seg id="95">About ninety percent of all people in these respective countries , I would estimate , have never ever heard that you can cook with solar energy .</seg>
<seg id="96">It 's no longer an issue anymore , yes it only works when the sun is shining , but the workers come home from the fields , in the late afternoon , evening , and they want to have a warm dinner in the evening .</seg>
<seg id="97">The biggest kitchen in the world that runs on solar energy , in India , that cooks over fifty thousand meals every time I believe , is a large yoga centre that uses Schleffler reflectors .</seg>
<seg id="98">These are basically also cookers , a little bigger , which direct their light at metal blocks , or stone blocks , and heat them for such a length of time that you can cook with it all night .</seg>
<seg id="99">So , that 's also not an issue , also the storage , very simple means , is much more effective than the complicated types , which we sometimes come up with because of research funds .</seg>
<seg id="100">Another brilliant idea , yes the so-called Watercone invented by a Bavarian designer , a designer from Munich .</seg>
<seg id="101">Water , salt water , tap water , something goes in , put it in the sun , it evaporates , it drains off , and outside there is this surrounding collecting ring .</seg>
<seg id="102">G I Z or G T Z , as it was called at the time , carried out a project of this kind in Yemen .</seg>
<seg id="103">Ten families each had ten Watercones , and they were to prepare their drinking water with them in Yemen .</seg>
<seg id="104">It worked .</seg>
<seg id="105">And the people themselves said the water tastes better than the water they buy in bottles .</seg>
<seg id="106">And let it be understood , no bottles are used here , there 's no waste , no transport costs and so on .</seg>
<seg id="107">You can also open up an old boiler , pack away the insulation , paint it black , and then you have a good solar collector too .</seg>
<seg id="108">So there are a number of things .</seg>
<seg id="109">We mentioned photovoltaics already , this is something by Solar Decathlon , or whatever it 's called , so this competition , which has been running for some years now , in which universities compete against each other , for simple homes that want to supply themselves with one hundred percent energy .</seg>
<seg id="110">Right , an aesthetically different taste , but it 's being done , a lot of experiments are being carried out .</seg>
<seg id="111">I myself am a supporter of solar technology in the field of shipping .</seg>
<seg id="112">This is the Solon , it 's here in Berlin .</seg>
<seg id="113">Because the experience I had with this , also with smaller solar ships , is just great .</seg>
<seg id="114">You set off with a half full battery on a sunny day , and if you don 't sail too fast , you 're back in the late afternoon with a full battery .</seg>
<seg id="115">Try that out with your car .</seg>
<seg id="116">I mean , the fact that simple energy resources exist , and in so many forms too .</seg>
<seg id="117">Back to my story .</seg>
<seg id="118">Wind energy .</seg>
<seg id="119">These machines in Persia as mills , two and a half thousand years old and they 're still around .</seg>
<seg id="120">They look exactly like the model here in the German Museum .</seg>
<seg id="121">Some of them even still work .</seg>
<seg id="122">That 's amazing , isn 't it .</seg>
<seg id="123">And a very modern vertical axis doesn 't look any different .</seg>
<seg id="124">Mind you , this involved man-years of development work and what have you .</seg>
<seg id="125">Of course it 's more efficient , more economical and that , but as for the principle .</seg>
<seg id="126">I mentioned IPAT a little while ago , they designed an oscillating-wing wind power generator for the Third World , where a vertical pump can basically be used .</seg>
<seg id="127">In the other direction there are the Flettner rotors , they were created by Enercon , the big E SHIP one , developed for offshore plants .</seg>
<seg id="128">But they used Flettner rotors .</seg>
<seg id="129">I don 't want to explain the physics behind it , you can find that on my homepage , but it 's a very interesting system .</seg>
<seg id="130">The surface area of the cylinder can be increased in your mind , the ten-fold surface area in the form of a sail , then you 'd have the equivalent of how effective they are .</seg>
<seg id="131">And it 's the first ship to have been built in recent history with this technology .</seg>
<seg id="132">Water , the next important resource .</seg>
<seg id="133">These are the oldest machines on our planet that are still turning .</seg>
<seg id="134">In Syria , on the Orontes river , in Hama , the Roman norias .</seg>
<seg id="135">Of course the wood is replaced in part every ten years , when it starts to rot .</seg>
<seg id="136">I asked the people too , and the axle , which runs over stone , smeared with water so to speak , they say , must be replaced once every generation .</seg>
<seg id="137">But it 's hydraulic power .</seg>
<seg id="138">Water is lifted for irrigation , in the past it was also used to supply a city .</seg>
<seg id="139">We spend a lot of money on wave power plants , huge things , Pelamis in Portugal , hardly heard anything about it in the last one or two years .</seg>
<seg id="140">They swim and are then supposed to produce electricity in their , well , limbs , via hydraulic power .</seg>
<seg id="141">And they do .</seg>
<seg id="142">I don 't know if it 's the right way .</seg>
<seg id="143">But I collected all systems , and they are one of them .</seg>
<seg id="144">A very interesting system from Austria , a gravitation water vortex power plant .</seg>
<seg id="145">Instead of the water just flowing vertically and a turbine moving , it has a spiral movement , and sputters off here .</seg>
<seg id="146">And I thought it was great that the inventor , Zotlöterer , put the very first system that he built , which is now four or five years ago , on the market immediately with an output of fifteen kilowatt .</seg>
<seg id="147">How many research projects take years before something comes out of it , and this man did this on his own initiative .</seg>
<seg id="148">Here you see the vortex on a small one to ten scale , how it is pulled in and goes out again at the bottom .</seg>
<seg id="149">And finally you put in the turbine , the generator is at the top in the box .</seg>
